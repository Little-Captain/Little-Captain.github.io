Getting Started with ANTLR v41.1. Installation1.1.1. UNIX1.1.2. WINDOWS1.1.3. Testing the installation1.2. A First Example1.3. Book source code1. Getting Started with ANTLR v4\nHi and welcome to the version 4 release of ANTLR! It's named after the fearless hero of the Crazy Nasty-Ass Honey Badger since ANTLR v4 takes whatever you give it--it just doesn't give a crap! See Why do we need ANTLR v4? and the preface of the ANTLR v4 book.\n1.1. Installation\nANTLR is really two things: a tool that translates your grammar to a parser/lexer in Java (or other target language) and the runtime needed by the generated parsers/lexers. Even if you are using the ANTLR Intellij plug-in or ANTLRWorks to run the ANTLR tool, the generated code will still need the runtime library. \nThe first thing you should do is probably download and install a development tool plug-in. Even if you only use such tools for editing, they are great. Then, follow the instructions below to get the runtime environment available to your system to run generated parsers/lexers.  In what follows, I talk about antlr-4.9-complete.jar, which has the tool and the runtime and any other support libraries (e.g., ANTLR v4 is written in v3).\nIf you are going to integrate ANTLR into your existing build system using mvn, ant, or want to get ANTLR into your IDE such as eclipse or intellij, see Integrating ANTLR into Development Systems.\n1.1.1. UNIX\n\nInstall Java (version 1.7 or higher)\nDownload\n$ cd /usr/local/lib\n$ curl -O https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.9-complete.jar\nOr just download in browser from website:\n https://www.antlr.org/download.html\nand put it somewhere rational like /usr/local/lib.\n\nAdd antlr-4.9-complete.jar to your CLASSPATH:\n$ export CLASSPATH=\".:/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.9-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH\"\nIt's also a good idea to put this in your .bash_profile or whatever your startup script is.\n\nCreate aliases for the ANTLR Tool, and TestRig.\n$ alias antlr4='java -Xmx500M -cp \"/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.9-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH\" org.antlr.v4.Tool'\n$ alias grun='java -Xmx500M -cp \"/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.9-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH\" org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig'\n\n\n1.1.2. WINDOWS\n(Thanks to Graham Wideman)\n\nInstall Java (version 1.7 or higher)\nDownload antlr-4.9-complete.jar (or whatever version) from https://www.antlr.org/download/\nSave to your directory for 3rd party Java libraries, say C:\\Javalib\nAdd antlr-4.9-complete.jar to CLASSPATH, either:\nPermanently: Using System Properties dialog > Environment variables > Create or append to CLASSPATH variable\nTemporarily, at command line:SET CLASSPATH=.;C:\\Javalib\\antlr-4.9-complete.jar;%CLASSPATH%\n\n\n\nCreate short convenient commands for the ANTLR Tool, and TestRig, using batch files or doskey commands:\nBatch files (in directory in system PATH) antlr4.bat and grun.batjava org.antlr.v4.Tool %*\n@ECHO OFF\nSET TEST_CURRENT_DIR=%CLASSPATH:.;=%\nif \"%TEST_CURRENT_DIR%\" == \"%CLASSPATH%\" ( SET CLASSPATH=.;%CLASSPATH% )\n@ECHO ON\njava org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig %*\n\nOr, use doskey commands:doskey antlr4=java org.antlr.v4.Tool $*\ndoskey grun =java org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig $*\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3. Testing the installation\nEither launch org.antlr.v4.Tool directly:\n$ java org.antlr.v4.Tool\nANTLR Parser Generator Version 4.9\n-o ___ specify output directory where all output is generated\n-lib ___ specify location of .tokens files\n...\nor use -jar option on java:\n$ java -jar /usr/local/lib/antlr-4.9-complete.jar\nANTLR Parser Generator Version 4.9\n-o ___ specify output directory where all output is generated\n-lib ___ specify location of .tokens files\n...\n1.2. A First Example\nIn a temporary directory, put the following grammar inside file Hello.g4:\nHello.g4\n// Define a grammar called Hello\ngrammar Hello;\nr  : 'hello' ID ;         // match keyword hello followed by an identifier\nID : [a-z]+ ;             // match lower-case identifiers\nWS : [ \\t\\r\\n]+ -> skip ; // skip spaces, tabs, newlines\nThen run ANTLR the tool on it:\n$ cd /tmp\n$ antlr4 Hello.g4\n$ javac Hello*.java\nNow test it:\n$ grun Hello r -tree\n(Now enter something like the string below)\nhello parrt\n(now,do:)\n^D\n(The output:)\n(r hello parrt)\n(That ^D means EOF on unix; it's ^Z in Windows.) The -tree option prints the parse tree in LISP notation.\nIt's nicer to look at parse trees visually.\n$ grun Hello r -gui\nhello parrt\n^D\nThat pops up a dialog box showing that rule r matched keyword hello followed by identifier parrt.\n\n1.3. Book source code\nThe book has lots and lots of examples that should be useful too. You can download them here for free:\nhttp://pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/source_code\nAlso, there is a large collection of grammars for v4 at github:\nhttps://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4\n"},"chapters/lexicon.html":{"url":"chapters/lexicon.html","title":"Grammar Lexicon","keywords":"","body":"1. Grammar Lexicon1.1. Comments1.2. Identifiers1.3. Literals1.4. Actions1.5. Keywords1. Grammar Lexicon\nThe lexicon of ANTLR is familiar to most programmers because it follows the syntax of C and its derivatives with some extensions for grammatical descriptions.\n1.1. Comments\nThere are single-line, multiline, and Javadoc-style comments:\n/** This grammar is an example illustrating the three kinds\n * of comments.\n */\ngrammar T;\n/* a multi-line\n  comment\n*/\n\n/** This rule matches a declarator for my language */\ndecl : ID ; // match a variable name\nThe Javadoc comments are hidden from the parser and are ignored at the moment.  They are intended to be used only at the start of the grammar and any rule.\n1.2. Identifiers\nToken names always start with a capital letter and so do lexer rules as defined by Java’s Character.isUpperCase method. Parser rule names always start with a lowercase letter (those that fail Character.isUpperCase). The initial character can be followed by uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores. Here are some sample names:\nID, LPAREN, RIGHT_CURLY // token names/lexer rules\nexpr, simpleDeclarator, d2, header_file // parser rule names\nLike Java, ANTLR accepts Unicode characters in ANTLR names:\n\nTo support Unicode parser and lexer rule names, ANTLR uses the following rule:\nID : a=NameStartChar NameChar*\n     {  \n     if ( Character.isUpperCase(getText().charAt(0)) ) setType(TOKEN_REF);\n     else setType(RULE_REF);\n     }  \n   ;\nRule NameChar identifies the valid identifier characters:\nfragment\nNameChar\n   : NameStartChar\n   | '0'..'9'\n   | '_'\n   | '\\u00B7'\n   | '\\u0300'..'\\u036F'\n   | '\\u203F'..'\\u2040'\n   ;\nfragment\nNameStartChar\n   : 'A'..'Z' | 'a'..'z'\n   | '\\u00C0'..'\\u00D6'\n   | '\\u00D8'..'\\u00F6'\n   | '\\u00F8'..'\\u02FF'\n   | '\\u0370'..'\\u037D'\n   | '\\u037F'..'\\u1FFF'\n   | '\\u200C'..'\\u200D'\n   | '\\u2070'..'\\u218F'\n   | '\\u2C00'..'\\u2FEF'\n   | '\\u3001'..'\\uD7FF'\n   | '\\uF900'..'\\uFDCF'\n   | '\\uFDF0'..'\\uFFFD'\n   ;\nRule NameStartChar is the list of characters that can start an identifier (rule, token, or label name):\nThese more or less correspond to isJavaIdentifierPart and isJavaIdentifierStart in Java’s Character class. Make sure to use the -encoding option on the ANTLR tool if your grammar file is not in UTF-8 format, so that ANTLR reads characters properly.\n1.3. Literals\nANTLR does not distinguish between character and string literals as most languages do. All literal strings one or more characters in length are enclosed in single quotes such as ’;’, ’if’, ’>=’, and ’\\’’ (refers to the one-character string containing the single quote character). Literals never contain regular expressions.\nLiterals can contain Unicode escape sequences of the form ’\\uXXXX’ (for Unicode code points up to ’U+FFFF’) or ’\\u{XXXXXX}’ (for all Unicode code points), where ’XXXX’ is the hexadecimal Unicode code point value.\nFor example, ’\\u00E8’ is the French letter with a grave accent: ’è’, and ’\\u{1F4A9}’ is the famous emoji: ’&#x1F4A9;’.\nANTLR also understands the usual special escape sequences: ’\\n’ (newline), ’\\r’ (carriage return), ’\\t’ (tab), ’\\b’ (backspace), and ’\\f’ (form feed). You can use Unicode code points directly within literals or use the Unicode escape sequences:\ngrammar Foreign;\na : '外' ;\nThe recognizers that ANTLR generates assume a character vocabulary containing all Unicode characters. The input file encoding assumed by the runtime library depends on the target language. For the Java target, the runtime library assumes files are in UTF-8. Using the  factory methods in CharStreams, you can specify a different encoding.\n1.4. Actions\nActions are code blocks written in the target language. You can use actions in a number of places within a grammar, but the syntax is always the same: arbitrary text surrounded by curly braces. You don’t need to escape a closing curly character if it’s in a string or comment: \"}\" or /*}*/. If the curlies are balanced, you also don’t need to escape }: {...}. Otherwise, escape extra curlies with a backslash: \\{ or \\}. The action text should conform to the target language as specified with the language option.\nEmbedded code can appear in: @header and @members named actions, parser and lexer rules, exception catching specifications, attribute sections for parser rules (return values, arguments, and locals), and some rule element options (currently predicates).\nThe only interpretation ANTLR does inside actions relates to grammar attributes; see Token Attributes and Chapter 10, Attributes and Actions. Actions embedded within lexer rules are emitted without any interpretation or translation into generated lexers.\n1.5. Keywords\nHere’s a list of the reserved words in ANTLR grammars:\nimport, fragment, lexer, parser, grammar, returns,\nlocals, throws, catch, finally, mode, options, tokens\nAlso, although it is not a keyword, do not use the word rule as a rule name. Further, do not use any keyword of the target language as a token, label, or rule name. For example, rule if would result in a generated function called if.  That would not compile obviously.\n"},"chapters/grammars.html":{"url":"chapters/grammars.html","title":"Grammar Structure","keywords":"","body":"1. Grammar Structure1.1. Grammar Imports1.2. Tokens Section1.3. Actions at the Grammar Level1. Grammar Structure\nA grammar is essentially a grammar declaration followed by a list of rules, but has the general form:\n/** Optional javadoc style comment */\ngrammar Name; ①\noptions {...}\nimport ... ;\n\ntokens {...}\nchannels {...} // lexer only\n@actionName {...}\n\nrule1 // parser and lexer rules, possibly intermingled\n...\nruleN\nThe file name containing grammar X must be called X.g4. You can specify options, imports, token specifications, and actions in any order. There can be at most one each of options, imports, and token specifications. All of those elements are optional except for the header ① and at least one rule. Rules take the basic form:\nruleName : alternative1 | ... | alternativeN ;\nParser rule names must start with a lowercase letter and lexer rules must start with a capital letter.\nGrammars defined without a prefix on the grammar header are combined grammars that can contain both lexical and parser rules. To make a parser grammar that only allows parser rules, use the following header.\nparser grammar Name;\n...\nAnd, naturally, a pure lexer grammar looks like this:\nlexer grammar Name;\n...\nOnly lexer grammars can contain mode specifications.\nOnly lexer grammars can contain custom channels specifications\nchannels {\n  WHITESPACE_CHANNEL,\n  COMMENTS_CHANNEL\n}\nThose channels can then be used like enums within lexer rules:\nWS : [ \\r\\t\\n]+ -> channel(WHITESPACE_CHANNEL) ;\nSections 15.5, Lexer Rules and Section 15.3, Parser Rules contain details on rule syntax. Section 15.8, Options describes grammar options and Section 15.4, Actions and Attributes has information on grammar-level actions.\n1.1. Grammar Imports\nGrammar imports let you break up a grammar into logical and reusable chunks, as we saw in Importing Grammars. ANTLR treats imported grammars very much like object-oriented programming languages treat superclasses. A grammar inherits all of the rules, tokens specifications, and named actions from the imported grammar. Rules in the “main grammar” override rules from imported grammars to implement inheritance.\nThink of import as more like a smart include statement (which does not include rules that are already defined). The result of all imports is a single combined grammar; the ANTLR code generator sees a complete grammar and has no idea there were imported grammars.\nTo process a main grammar, the ANTLR tool loads all of the imported grammars into subordinate grammar objects. It then merges the rules, token types, and named actions from the imported grammars into the main grammar. In the diagram below, the grammar on the right illustrates the effect of grammar MyELang importing grammar ELang.\n\nMyELang inherits rules stat, WS, and ID, but overrides rule expr and adds INT. Here’s a sample build and test run that shows MyELang can recognize integer expressions whereas the original ELang can’t. The third, erroneous input statement triggers an error message that also demonstrates the parser was looking for MyELang’s expr not ELang’s.\n$ antlr4 MyELang.g4\n$ javac MyELang*.java\n$ grun MyELang stat\n=>     34;\n=>     a;\n=>     ;\n=>     EOF\nIf there are modes in the main grammar or any of the imported grammars then the import process will import those modes and merge their rules where they are not overridden. In the event any mode becomes empty as all its\nrules have been overridden by rules outside the mode this mode will be discarded.\nIf there were any tokens specifications, the main grammar would merge the token sets. If there were any channel specifications, the main grammar would merge the channel sets. Any named actions such as @members would be merged. In general, you should avoid named actions and actions within rules in imported grammars since that limits their reuse. ANTLR also ignores any options in imported grammars.\nImported grammars can also import other grammars. ANTLR pursues all imported grammars in a depth-first fashion. If two or more imported grammars define rule r, ANTLR chooses the first version of r it finds. In the following diagram, ANTLR examines grammars in the following order Nested, G1, G3, G2.\n\nNested includes the r rule from G3 because it sees that version before the r in G2.\nNot every kind of grammar can import every other kind of grammar:\n\nLexer grammars can import lexers, including lexers containing modes.\nParsers can import parsers.\nCombined grammars can import parsers or lexers without modes.\n\nANTLR adds imported rules to the end of the rule list in a main lexer grammar. That means lexer rules in the main grammar get precedence over imported rules. For example, if a main grammar defines rule IF : ’if’ ; and an imported grammar defines rule ID : [a-z]+ ; (which also recognizes if), the imported ID won’t hide the main grammar’s IF token definition.\n1.2. Tokens Section\nThe purpose of the tokens section is to define token types needed by a grammar for which there is no associated lexical rule. The basic syntax is:\ntokens { Token1, ..., TokenN }\nMost of the time, the tokens section is used to define token types needed by actions in the grammar as shown in Section 10.3, Recognizing Languages whose Keywords Aren’t Fixed:\n// explicitly define keyword token types to avoid implicit definition warnings\ntokens { BEGIN, END, IF, THEN, WHILE }\n\n@lexer::members { // keywords map used in lexer to assign token types\nMap keywords = new HashMap() {{\n    put(\"begin\", KeywordsParser.BEGIN);\n    put(\"end\", KeywordsParser.END);\n    ...\n}};\n}\nThe tokens section really just defines a set of tokens to add to the overall set.\n$ cat Tok.g4\ngrammar Tok;\ntokens { A, B, C }\na : X ;\n$ antlr4 Tok.g4\nwarning(125): Tok.g4:3:4: implicit definition of token X in parser\n$ cat Tok.tokens\nA=1\nB=2\nC=3\nX=4\n1.3. Actions at the Grammar Level\nCurrently there are only two defined named actions (for the Java target) used outside of grammar rules: header and members. The former injects code into the generated recognizer class file, before the recognizer class definition, and the latter injects code into the recognizer class definition, as fields and methods.\nFor combined grammars, ANTLR injects the actions into both the parser and the lexer. To restrict an action to the generated parser or lexer, use @parser::name or @lexer::name.\nHere’s an example where the grammar specifies a package for the generated code:\ngrammar Count;\n\n@header {\npackage foo;\n}\n\n@members {\nint count = 0;\n}\n\nlist\n@after {System.out.println(count+\" ints\");}\n: INT {count++;} (',' INT {count++;} )*\n;\n\nINT : [0-9]+ ;\nWS : [ \\r\\t\\n]+ -> skip ;\nThe grammar itself then should be in directory foo so that ANTLR generates code in that same foo directory (at least when not using the -o ANTLR tool option):\n$ cd foo\n$ antlr4 Count.g4 # generates code in the current directory (foo)\n$ ls\nCount.g4        CountLexer.java    CountParser.java\nCount.tokens    CountLexer.tokens\nCountBaseListener.java CountListener.java\n$ javac *.java\n$ cd ..\n$ grun foo.Count list\n=>     9, 10, 11\n=>     EOF\nThe Java compiler expects classes in package foo to be in directory foo.\n"},"chapters/parser-rules.html":{"url":"chapters/parser-rules.html","title":"Parser Rules","keywords":"","body":"1. Parser Rules1.1. Alternative Labels1.2. Rule Context Objects1.3. Rule Element Labels1.4. Rule Elements1.5. Subrules1.6. Catching Exceptions1.7. Rule Attribute Definitions1.8. Start Rules and EOF1. Parser Rules\nParsers consist of a set of parser rules either in a parser or a combined grammar. A Java application launches a parser by invoking the rule function, generated by ANTLR, associated with the desired start rule. The most basic rule is just a rule name followed by a single alternative terminated with a semicolon:\n     /** Javadoc comment can precede rule */\n     retstat : 'return' expr ';' ;\nRules can also have alternatives separated by the | \noperator:\n     stat: retstat\n     | 'break' ';'\n     | 'continue' ';'\n     ;\nAlternatives are either a list of rule elements or empty. For example, here’s a rule with an empty alternative that makes the entire rule optional:\nsuperClass\n     : 'extends' ID\n     | // empty means other alternative(s) are optional\n     ;\n1.1. Alternative Labels\nAs we saw in Section 7.4, Labeling Rule Alternatives for Precise Event Methods, we can get more precise parse-tree listener events by labeling the outermost alternatives of a rule using the # operator. All alternatives within a rule must be labeled, or none of them. Here are two rules with labeled alternatives.\ngrammar T;\nstat: 'return' e ';' # Return\n     | 'break' ';' # Break\n     ;\ne   : e '*' e # Mult\n    | e '+' e # Add\n    | INT # Int\n    ;\nAlternative labels do not have to be at the end of the line and there does not have to be a space after the # symbol.\nANTLR generates a rule context class definition for each label. For example, here is the listener that ANTLR generates:\npublic interface AListener extends ParseTreeListener {\n     void enterReturn(AParser.ReturnContext ctx);\n     void exitReturn(AParser.ReturnContext ctx);\n     void enterBreak(AParser.BreakContext ctx);\n     void exitBreak(AParser.BreakContext ctx);\n     void enterMult(AParser.MultContext ctx);\n     void exitMult(AParser.MultContext ctx);\n     void enterAdd(AParser.AddContext ctx);\n     void exitAdd(AParser.AddContext ctx);\n     void enterInt(AParser.IntContext ctx);\n     void exitInt(AParser.IntContext ctx);\n}\n\nThere are enter and exit methods associated with each labeled alternative. The parameters to those methods are specific to alternatives.\nYou can reuse the same label on multiple alternatives to indicate that the parse tree walker should trigger the same event for those alternatives. For example, here’s a variation on rule e from grammar A above:\n     e : e '*' e # BinaryOp\n     | e '+' e # BinaryOp\n     | INT # Int\n     ;\nANTLR would generate the following listener methods for e:\n     void enterBinaryOp(AParser.BinaryOpContext ctx);\n     void exitBinaryOp(AParser.BinaryOpContext ctx);\n     void enterInt(AParser.IntContext ctx);\n     void exitInt(AParser.IntContext ctx);\n\nANTLR gives errors if an alternative name conflicts with a rule name. Here’s another rewrite of rule e where two \nalternative labels conflict with rule names:\n     e : e '*' e # e\n     | e '+' e # Stat\n     | INT # Int\n     ;\nThe context objects generated from rule names and labels get capitalized and so label Stat conflicts with rule stat:\n     $ antlr4 A.g4\n     error(124): A.g4:5:23: rule alt label e conflicts with rule e\n     error(124): A.g4:6:23: rule alt label Stat conflicts with rule stat\n     warning(125): A.g4:2:13: implicit definition of token INT in parser\n\n1.2. Rule Context Objects\nANTLR generates methods to access the rule context objects (parse tree nodes) associated with each rule reference. For rules with a single rule reference, ANTLR generates a method with no arguments. Consider the following rule.\n     inc : e '++' ;\nANTLR generates this context class:\npublic static class IncContext extends ParserRuleContext {\n     public EContext e() { ... } // return context object associated with e\n     ...\n}\n\nANTLR also provide support to access context objects when there is more than a single reference to a rule:\nfield : e '.' e ;\nANTLR generates a method with an index to access the ith element as well as a method to get context for all references to that rule:\npublic static class FieldContext extends ParserRuleContext {\n     public EContext e(int i) { ... } // get ith e context\n     public List e() { ... } // return ALL e contexts\n     ...\n}\n\nIf we had another rule, s, that references field, an embedded action could access the list of e rule matches performed by field:\ns : field\n     {\n     List x = $field.ctx.e();\n     ...\n     }\n;\nA listener or visitor could do the same thing. Given a pointer to a FieldContext object, f, f.e() would return List.\n1.3. Rule Element Labels\nYou can label rule elements using the = operator to add fields to the rule context objects:\nstat: 'return' value=e ';' # Return\n     | 'break' ';' # Break\n     ;\nHere value is the label for the return value of rule e, which is defined elsewhere.\nLabels become fields in the appropriate parse tree node class. In this case, label value becomes a field in ReturnContext because of the Return alternative label:\npublic static class ReturnContext extends StatContext {\n     public EContext value;\n     ...\n}\n\nIt’s often handy to track a number of tokens, which you can do with the += “list label” operator. For example, the following rule creates a list of the Token objects matched for a simple array construct:\n     array : '{' el+=INT (',' el+=INT)* '}' ;\nANTLR generates a List field in the appropriate rule context class:\n     public static class ArrayContext extends ParserRuleContext {\n     public List el = new ArrayList();\n     ...\n     }\nThese list labels also work for rule references:\n     elist : exprs+=e (',' exprs+=e)* ;\nANTLR generates a field holding the list of context objects:\n     public static class ElistContext extends ParserRuleContext {\n     public List exprs = new ArrayList();\n     ...\n     }\n1.4. Rule Elements\nRule elements specify what the parser should do at a given moment just like statements in a programming language. The elements can be rule, token, string literal like expression, ID, and ’return’. Here’s a complete list of the rule elements (we’ll look at actions and predicates in more detail later):\n\n\nSyntaxDescription\n\n\nT\nMatch token T at the current input position. Tokens always begin with a capital letter.\n\n\n’literal’\nMatch the string literal at the current input position. A string literal is simply a token with a fixed string.\n\n\nr\nMatch rule r at current input position, which amounts to invoking the rule just like a function call. Parser rule names always begin with a lowercase letter.\n\n\nr [«args»]\nMatch rule r at current input position, passing in a list of arguments just like a function call. The arguments inside the square brackets are in the syntax of the target language and are usually a comma-separated list of expressions.\n\n\n{«action»}\nExecute an action immediately after the preceding alternative element and immediately before the following alternative element. The action conforms to the syntax of the target language. ANTLR copies the action code to the generated class verbatim, except for substituting attribute and token references such as $x and $x.y.\n\n\n{«p»}?\nEvaluate semantic predicate «p». Do not continue parsing past a predicate if «p» evaluates to false at runtime. Predicates encountered during prediction, when ANTLR distinguishes between alternatives, enable or disable the alternative(s) surrounding the predicate(s).\n\n\n.\nMatch any single token except for the end of file token. The “dot” operator is called the wildcard.\n\n\n\nWhen you want to match everything but a particular token or set of tokens, use the ~ “not” operator. This operator is rarely used in the parser but is available. ~INT matches any token except the INT token. ~’,’ matches any token except the comma. ~(INT|ID) matches any token except an INT or an ID.\nToken, string literal, and semantic predicate rule elements can take options. See Rule Element Options.\n1.5. Subrules\nA rule can contain alternative blocks called subrules (as allowed in Extended BNF Notation: EBNF). A subrule is like a rule that lacks a name and is enclosed in parentheses. Subrules can have one or more alternatives inside the parentheses. Subrules cannot define attributes with locals and returns like rules can. There are four kinds of subrules (x, y, and z represent grammar fragments):\n\n\nSyntaxDescription\n\n\n(x|y|z).\nMatch any alternative within the subrule exactly once. Example:\n\n\nreturnType : (type | 'void') ;\n\n\n\n\n(x|y|z)?\nMatch nothing or any alternative within subrule. Example:\n\n    \nclassDeclaration\n    : 'class' ID (typeParameters)? ('extends' type)?\n      ('implements' typeList)?\n        classBody\n    ;\n\n\n(x|y|z)*\nMatch an alternative within subrule zero or more times. Example:\n\n\nannotationName : ID ('.' ID)* ;\n\n\n    \n(x|y|z)+\nMatch an alternative within subrule one or more times. Example:\n\n\nannotations : (annotation)+ ;\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can suffix the ?, *, and + subrule operators with the nongreedy operator, which is also a question mark: ??, *?, and +?. See Section 15.6, Wildcard Operator and Nongreedy Subrules.\nAs a shorthand, you can omit the parentheses for subrules composed of a single alternative with a single rule element reference. For example, annotation+ is the same as (annotation)+ and ID+ is the same as (ID)+. Labels also work with the shorthand. ids+=INT+ make a list of INT token objects.\n1.6. Catching Exceptions\nWhen a syntax error occurs within a rule, ANTLR catches the exception, reports the error, attempts to recover (possibly by consuming more tokens), and then returns from the rule. Every rule is wrapped in a try/catch/finally statement:\nvoid r() throws RecognitionException {\n     try {\n         rule-body\n     }\n     catch (RecognitionException re) {\n         _errHandler.reportError(this, re);\n         _errHandler.recover(this, re);\n     }\n     finally {\n        exitRule();\n     }\n}\nIn Section 9.5, Altering ANTLR’s Error Handling Strategy, we saw how to use a strategy object to alter ANTLR’s error handling. Replacing the strategy changes the strategy for all rules, however. To alter the exception handling for a single rule, specify an exception after the rule definition:\nr : ...\n  ;\n  catch[RecognitionException e] { throw e; }\nThat example shows how to avoid default error reporting and recovery. r rethrows the exception, which is useful when it makes more sense for a higher-level rule to report the error. Specifying any exception clause, prevents ANTLR from generating a clause to handle RecognitionException.\nYou can specify other exceptions as well:\nr : ...\n  ;\n  catch[FailedPredicateException fpe] { ... }\n  catch[RecognitionException e] { ... }\nThe code snippets inside curly braces and the exception “argument” actions must be written in the target language; Java, in this case.\nWhen you need to execute an action even if an exception occurs, put it into the finally clause:\nr : ...\n  ;\n  // catch blocks go first\n  finally { System.out.println(\"exit rule r\"); }\nThe finally clause executes right before the rule triggers exitRule before returning. If you want to execute an action after the rule finishes matching the alternatives but before it does its cleanup work, use an after action.\nHere’s a complete list of exceptions:\n\n\nException nameDescription\n\n\nRecognitionException\nThe superclass of all exceptions thrown by an ANTLR-generated recognizer. It’s a subclass of RuntimeException to avoid the hassles of checked exceptions. This exception records where the recognizer (lexer or parser) was in the input, where it was in the ATN (internal graph data structure representing the grammar), the rule invocation stack, and what kind of problem occurred.\n\n\nNoViableAltException\nIndicates that the parser could not decide which of two or more paths to take by looking at the remaining input. This exception tracks the starting token of the offending input and also knows where the parser was in the various paths when the error occurred.\n\n\nLexerNoViableAltException\nThe equivalent of NoViableAltException but for lexers only.\n\n\nInputMismatchException\nThe current input Token does not match what the parser expected.\n\n\nFailedPredicateException\nA semantic predicate that evaluates to false during prediction renders the surrounding alternative nonviable. Prediction occurs when a rule is predicting which alternative to take. If all viable paths disappear, parser will throw NoViableAltException. This predicate gets thrown by the parser when a semantic predicate evaluates to false outside of prediction, during the normal parsing process of matching tokens and calling rules.\n\n\n\n1.7. Rule Attribute Definitions\nThere are a number of action-related syntax elements associated with rules to be aware of. Rules can have arguments, return values, and local variables just like functions in a programming language. (Rules can have actions embedded among the rule elements, as we’ll see in Section 15.4, Actions and Attributes.) ANTLR collects all of the variables you define and stores them in the rule context object. These variables are usually called attributes. Here’s the general syntax showing all possible attribute definition locations:\nrulename[args] returns [retvals] locals [localvars] : ... ;\nThe attributes defined within those [...] can be used like any other variable. Here is a sample rule that copies parameters to return values:\n// Return the argument plus the integer value of the INT token\nadd[int x] returns [int result] : '+=' INT {$result = $x + $INT.int;} ;\nThe args, locals, and return [...] are generally in the target language but with some constraints. The [...] string is a comma-separated list of declarations either with prefix or postfix type notation or no-type notation. The elements can have initializer such as [int x = 32, float y] but don't go too crazy as we are parsing this generic text manually in ScopeParser.  \n\nJava, CSharp, C++ use int x notation but C++ must use a slightly altered notation for array references, int[] x, to fit in the type id syntax.\nGo and Swift give the type after the variable name, but Swift requires a : in between. Go i int, Swift i:int.  For Go target, you must either use int i or i:int.\nPython and JavaScript don't specify static types so actions are just identifier lists such as [i,j].\n\nTechnically any target could use either notation. For examples, see TestScopeParsing.\nAs with the grammar level, you can specify rule-level named actions. For rules, the valid names are init and after. As the names imply, parsers execute init actions immediately before trying to match the associated rule and execute after actions immediately after matching the rule. ANTLR after actions do not execute as part of the finally code block of the generated rule function. Use the ANTLR finally action to place code in the generated rule function finally code block.\nThe actions come after any argument, return value, or local attribute definition actions. The row rule preamble from Section 10.2, Accessing Token and Rule Attributes illustrates the syntax nicely:\nactions/CSV.g4\n/** Derived from rule \"row : field (',' field)* '\\r'? '\\n' ;\" */\nrow[String[] columns]\n   returns [Map values]\n   locals [int col=0]\n    @init {\n    $values = new HashMap();\n    }\n    @after {\n    if ($values!=null && $values.size()>0) {\n    System.out.println(\"values = \"+$values);\n    }\n    }\n    : ...\n    ;\nRule row takes argument columns, returns values, and defines local variable col. The “actions” in square brackets are copied directly into the generated code:\npublic class CSVParser extends Parser {\n    ...\n    public static class RowContext extends ParserRuleContext {\n        public String [] columns;\n        public Map values;\n        public int col=0;\n        ...\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nThe generated rule functions also specify the rule arguments as function arguments, but they are quickly copied into the local RowContext object:\npublic class CSVParser extends Parser {\n     ...\n     public final RowContext row(String [] columns) throws RecognitionException {\n         RowContext _localctx = new RowContext(_ctx, 4, columns);\n         enterRule(_localctx, RULE_row);\n         ...\n     }\n     ...\n}\n\nANTLR tracks nested [...] within the action so that String[] columns is parsed properly. It also tracks angle brackets so that commas within generic type parameters do not signify the start of another attribute. Map values is one attribute definition.\nThere can be multiple attributes in each action, even for return values. Use a comma to separate attributes within the same action:\na[Map x, int y] : ... ;\nANTLR interprets that action to define two arguments, x and y:\npublic final AContext a(Map x, int y)\n    throws RecognitionException\n{\n    AContext _localctx = new AContext(_ctx, 0, x, y);\n    enterRule(_localctx, RULE_a);\n    ...\n}\n\n1.8. Start Rules and EOF\nA start rule is the rule engaged first by the parser; it’s the rule function called by the language application. For example, a language application that parsed to Java code might call parser.compilationUnit() for a JavaParser object called parser. Any rule in the grammar can act as a start rule.\nStart rules don’t necessarily consume all of the input. They consume only as much input as needed to match an alternative of the rule. For example, consider the following rule that matches one, two, or three tokens, depending on the input.\ns : ID\n  | ID '+'\n  | ID '+' INT\n  ;\nUpon a+3, rule s matches the third alternative. Upon a+b, it matches the second alternative and ignores the final b token. Upon a b, it matches the first alternative, ignoring the b token. The parser does not consume the complete input in the latter two cases because rule s doesn’t explicitly say that end of file must occur after matching an alternative of the rule.\nThis default functionality is very useful for building things like IDEs. Imagine the IDE wanting to parse a method somewhere in the middle of a big Java file. Calling rule methodDeclaration should try to match just a method and ignore whatever comes next.\nOn the other hand, rules that describe entire input files should reference special predefined-token EOF. If they don’t, you might scratch your head for a while wondering why the start rule doesn’t report errors for any input no matter what you give it. Here’s a rule that’s part of a grammar for reading configuration files:\nconfig : element*; // can \"match\" even with invalid input.\nInvalid input would cause config to return immediately without matching any input and without reporting an error. Here’s the proper specification:\nfile : element* EOF; // don't stop early. must match all input\n"},"chapters/left-recursion.html":{"url":"chapters/left-recursion.html","title":"Left-recursive rules","keywords":"","body":"1. Left-recursive rules1.1. Formal rules1. Left-recursive rules\nThe most natural expression of some common language constructs is left recursive. For example C declarators and arithmetic expressions. Unfortunately, left recursive specifications of arithmetic expressions are typically ambiguous but much easier to write out than the multiple levels required in a typical top-down grammar. Here is a sample ANTLR 4 grammar with a left recursive expression rule:\nstat: expr '=' expr ';' // e.g., x=y; or x=f(x);\n    | expr ';'          // e.g., f(x); or f(g(x));\n    ;\nexpr: expr '*' expr\n    | expr '+' expr\n    | expr '(' expr ')' // f(x)\n    | id\n    ;\nIn straight context free grammars, such a rule is ambiguous because 1+2*3 it can interpret either operator as occurring first, but ANTLR rewrites that to be non-left recursive and unambiguous using semantic predicates:\nexpr[int pr] : id\n               ( {4 >= $pr}? '*' expr[5]\n               | {3 >= $pr}? '+' expr[4]\n               | {2 >= $pr}? '(' expr[0] ')'\n               )*\n             ;\nThe predicates resolve ambiguities by comparing the precedence of the current operator against the precedence of the previous operator. An expansion of expr[pr] can match only those subexpressions whose precedence meets or exceeds pr.\n1.1. Formal rules\nThe formal 4.0, 4.1 ANTLR left-recursion elimination rules were changed (simplified) for 4.2 and are laid out in the ALL(*) tech report:\n\nBinary expressions are expressions which contain a recursive invocation of the rule as the first and last element of the alternative.\nSuffix expressions contain a recursive invocation of the rule as the first element of the alternative, but not as the last element.\nPrefix expressions contain a recursive invocation of the rule as the last element of the alternative, but not as the first element.\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"ternary\" expression--they are just binary expressions in disguise.\nThe right associativity specifiers used to be on the individual tokens but it's done on alternative basis anyway so the option is now on the individual alternative; e.g.,\ne : e '*' e\n  | e '+' e\n  | e '?' e ':' e\n  | e '=' e\n  | INT\n  ;\nIf your 4.0 or 4.1 grammar uses a right-associative ternary operator, you will need to update your grammar to include  on the alternative operator. To smooth the transition,  is still allowed on token references but it is ignored.\n"},"chapters/actions.html":{"url":"chapters/actions.html","title":"Actions and Attributes","keywords":"","body":"1. Actions and Attributes1.1. Token Attributes1.2. Parser Rule Attributes1.3. Dynamically-Scoped Attributes1. Actions and Attributes\nIn Chapter 10, Attributes and Actions, we learned how to embed actions within grammars and looked at the most common token and rule attributes. This section summarizes the important syntax and semantics from that chapter and provides a complete list of all available attributes. (You can learn more about actions in the grammar from the free excerpt on listeners and actions.)\nActions are blocks of text written in the target language and enclosed in curly braces. The recognizer triggers them according to their locations within the grammar. For example, the following rule emits \"found a decl\" after the parser has seen a valid declaration:\ndecl: type ID ';' {System.out.println(\"found a decl\");} ;\ntype: 'int' | 'float' ;\nMost often, actions access the attributes of tokens and rule references:\ndecl: type ID ';'\n      {System.out.println(\"var \"+$ID.text+\":\"+$type.text+\";\");}\n    | t=ID id=ID ';'\n      {System.out.println(\"var \"+$id.text+\":\"+$t.text+\";\");}\n    ;\n1.1. Token Attributes\nAll tokens have a collection of predefined, read-only attributes. The attributes include useful token properties such as the token type and text matched for a token. Actions can access these attributes via $label.attribute where label labels a particular instance of a token reference (a and b in the example below are used in the action code as $a and $b). Often, a particular token is only referenced once in the rule, in which case the token name itself can be used unambiguously in the action code (token INT can be used as $INT in the action). The following example illustrates token attribute expression syntax:\nr : INT {int x = $INT.line;}\n    ( ID {if ($INT.line == $ID.line) ...;} )?\n    a=FLOAT b=FLOAT {if ($a.line == $b.line) ...;}\n  ;\nThe action within the (...)? subrule can see the INT token matched before it in the outer level.\nBecause there are two references to the FLOAT token, a reference to $FLOAT in an action is not unique; you must use labels to specify which token reference you’re interested in.\nToken references within different alternatives are unique because only one of them can be matched for any invocation of the rule. For example, in the following rule, actions in both alternatives can reference $ID directly without using a label:\n     r : ... ID {System.out.println($ID.text);}\n     | ... ID {System.out.println($ID.text);}\n     ;\nTo access the tokens matched for literals, you must use a label:\n     stat: r='return' expr ';' {System.out.println(\"line=\"+$r.line);} ;\nMost of the time you access the attributes of the token, but sometimes it is useful to access the Token object itself because it aggregates all the attributes. Further, you can use it to test whether an optional subrule matched a token:\n     stat: 'if' expr 'then' stat (el='else' stat)?\n     {if ( $el!=null ) System.out.println(\"found an else\");}\n     | ...\n     ;\n$T and $L evaluate to Token objects for token name T and token label L. $ll evaluates to List for list label ll. $T.attr evaluates to the type and value specified in the following table for attribute attr:\n\n\n\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntext\nString\nThe text matched for the token; translates to a call to getText. Example: $ID.text.\n\n\ntype\nint\nThe token type (nonzero positive integer) of the token such as INT; translates to a call to getType. Example: $ID.type.\n\n\nline\nint\nThe line number on which the token occurs, counting from 1; translates to a call to getLine. Example: $ID.line.\n\n\npos\nint\nThe character position within the line at which the token’s first character occurs counting from zero; translates to a call togetCharPositionInLine. Example: $ID.pos.\n\n\nindex\nint\nThe overall index of this token in the token stream, counting from zero; translates to a call to getTokenIndex. Example: $ID.index.\n\n\nchannel\nint\nThe token’s channel number. The parser tunes to only one channel, effectively ignoring off-channel tokens. The default channel is 0 (Token.DEFAULT_CHANNEL), and the default hidden channel is Token.HIDDEN_CHANNEL. Translates to a call to getChannel. Example: $ID.channel.\n\n\nint\nint\nThe integer value of the text held by this token; it assumes that the text is a valid numeric string. Handy for building calculators and so on. Translates to Integer.valueOf(text-of-token). Example: $INT.int.\n\n\n\n1.2. Parser Rule Attributes\nANTLR predefines a number of read-only attributes associated with parser rule references that are available to actions. Actions can access rule attributes only for references that precede the action. The syntax is $r.attr for rule name r or a label assigned to a rule reference. For example, $expr.text returns the complete text matched by a preceding invocation of rule expr:\nreturnStat : 'return' expr {System.out.println(\"matched \"+$expr.text);} ;\nUsing a rule label looks like this:\nreturnStat : 'return' e=expr {System.out.println(\"matched \"+e.text);} ;\nYou can also use $ followed by the name of the attribute to access the value associated with the currently executing rule. For example, $start is the starting token of the current rule.\nreturnStat : 'return' expr {System.out.println(\"first token \"+$start.getText());} ;\n$r and $rl evaluate to ParserRuleContext objects of type RContext for rule name r and rule label rl. $rll evaluates to List for rule list label rll. $r.attr evaluates to the type and value specified in the following table for attribute attr:\n\n\n\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntext\nString\nThe text matched for a rule or the text matched from the start of the rule up until the point of the $text expression evaluation. Note that this includes the text for all tokens including those on hidden channels, which is what you want because usually that has all the whitespace and comments. When referring to the current rule, this attribute is available in any action including any exception actions.\n\n\nstart\nToken\nThe first token to be potentially matched by the rule that is on the main token channel; in other words, this attribute is never a hidden token. For rules that end up matching no tokens, this attribute points at the first token that could have been matched by this rule. When referring to the current rule, this attribute is available to any action within the rule.\n\n\nstop\nToken\nThe last nonhidden channel token to be matched by the rule. When referring to the current rule, this attribute is available only to the after and finally actions.\n\n\nctx\nParserRuleContext\nThe rule context object associated with a rule invocation. All of the other attributes are available through this attribute. For example, $ctx.start accesses the start field within the current rules context object. It’s the same as $start.\n\n\n\n1.3. Dynamically-Scoped Attributes\nYou can pass information to and from rules using parameters and return values, just like functions in a general-purpose programming language. Programming languages don’t allow functions to access the local variables or parameters of invoking functions, however. For example, the following reference to local variable x form a nested method call is illegal in Java:\nvoid f() {\n    int x = 0;\n    g();\n}\nvoid g() {\n    h();\n}\nvoid h() {\n    int y = x; // INVALID reference to f's local variable x\n}\n\nVariable x is available only within the scope of f, which is the text lexically delimited by curly brackets. For this reason, Java is said to use lexical scoping. Lexical scoping is the norm for most programming languages. Languages that allow methods further down in the call chain to access local variables defined earlier are said to use dynamic scoping. The term dynamic refers to the fact that a compiler cannot statically determine the set of visible variables. This is because the set of variables visible to a method changes depending on who calls that method.\nIt turns out that, in the grammar realm, distant rules sometimes need to communicate with each other, mostly to provide context information to rules matched below in the rule invocation chain. (Naturally, this assumes that you are using actions directly in the grammar instead of the parse-tree listener event mechanism.) ANTLR allows dynamic scoping in that actions can access attributes from invoking rules using syntax $r::x where r is a rule name and x is an attribute within that rule. It is up to the programmer to ensure that r is in fact an invoking rule of the current rule. A runtime exception occurs if r is not in the current call chain when you access $r::x.\nTo illustrate the use of dynamic scoping, consider the real problem of defining variables and ensuring that variables in expressions are defined. The following grammar defines the symbols attribute where it belongs in the block rule but adds variable names to it in rule decl. Rule stat then consults the list to see whether variables have been defined.\ngrammar DynScope;\n\nprog: block ;\n\nblock\n    /* List of symbols defined within this block */\n    locals [\n    List symbols = new ArrayList()\n    ]\n    : '{' decl* stat+ '}'\n    // print out all symbols found in block\n    // $block::symbols evaluates to a List as defined in scope\n    {System.out.println(\"symbols=\"+$symbols);}\n    ;\n\n/** Match a declaration and add identifier name to list of symbols */\ndecl: 'int' ID {$block::symbols.add($ID.text);} ';' ;\n\n/** Match an assignment then test list of symbols to verify\n * that it contains the variable on the left side of the assignment.\n * Method contains() is List.contains() because $block::symbols\n * is a List.\n */\nstat: ID '=' INT ';'\n    {\n    if ( !$block::symbols.contains($ID.text) ) {\n    System.err.println(\"undefined variable: \"+$ID.text);\n    }\n    }\n    | block\n    ;\n\nID : [a-z]+ ;\nINT : [0-9]+ ;\nWS : [ \\t\\r\\n]+ -> skip ;\nHere’s a simple build and test sequence:\n$ antlr4 DynScope.g4\n$ javac DynScope*.java\n$ grun DynScope prog\n=>     {\n=>     int i;\n=>     i = 0;\n=>     j = 3;\n=>     }\n=>     EOF\n\nThere’s an important difference between a simple field declaration in a @members action and dynamic scoping. symbols is a local variable and so there is a copy for each invocation of rule block. That’s exactly what we want for nested blocks so that we can reuse the same input variable name in an inner block. For example, the following nested code block redefines i in the inner scope. This new definition must hide the definition in the outer scope.\n{\n    int i;\n    int j;\n    i = 0;\n    {\n        int i;\n        int x;\n        x = 5;\n    }\n    x = 3;\n}\nHere’s the output generated for that input by DynScope:\n$ grun DynScope prog nested-input\nsymbols=[i, x]\nundefined variable: x\nsymbols=[i, j]\n\nReferencing $block::symbols accesses the symbols field of the most recently invoked block’s rule context object. If you need access to a symbols instance from a rule invocation farther up the call chain, you can walk backwards starting at the current context, $ctx. Use getParent to walk up the chain.\n"},"chapters/lexer-rules.html":{"url":"chapters/lexer-rules.html","title":"Lexer Rules","keywords":"","body":"1. Lexer Rules1.1. Lexical Modes1.2.

Lexer Commands1.6.1. skip1.6.2. mode(), pushMode(), popMode, and more1.6.3. type()1.6.4. channel()1. Lexer Rules\nA lexer grammar is composed of lexer rules, optionally broken into multiple modes. Lexical modes allow us to split a single lexer grammar into multiple sublexers. The lexer can only return tokens matched by rules from the current mode.\nLexer rules specify token definitions and more or less follow the syntax of parser rules except that lexer rules cannot have arguments, return values, or local variables. Lexer rule names must begin with an uppercase letter, which distinguishes them from parser rule names:\n/** Optional document comment */\nTokenName : alternative1 | ... | alternativeN ;\nYou can also define rules that are not tokens but rather aid in the recognition of tokens. These fragment rules do not result in tokens visible to the parser:\nfragment\nHelperTokenRule : alternative1 | ... | alternativeN ;\nFor example, DIGIT is a pretty common fragment rule:\nINT : DIGIT+ ; // references the DIGIT helper rule\nfragment DIGIT : [0-9] ; // not a token by itself\n1.1. Lexical Modes\nModes allow you to group lexical rules by context, such as inside and outside of XML tags. It’s like having multiple sublexers, one for each context. The lexer can only return tokens matched by entering a rule in the current mode. Lexers start out in the so-called default mode. All rules are considered to be within the default mode unless you specify a mode command. Modes are not allowed within combined grammars, just lexer grammars. (See grammar XMLLexer from Tokenizing XML.)\nrules in default mode\n...\nmode MODE1;\nrules in MODE1\n...\nmode MODEN;\nrules in MODEN\n...\n1.2. Lexer Rule Elements\nLexer rules allow two constructs that are unavailable to parser rules: the .. range operator and the character set notation enclosed in square brackets, [characters]. Don’t confuse character sets with arguments to parser rules. [characters] only means character set in a lexer. Here’s a summary of all lexer rule elements:\n\n\nSyntaxDescription\n\n\nT\nMatch token T at the current input position. Tokens always begin with a capital letter.\n\n\n\n’literal’\nMatch that character or sequence of characters. E.g., ’while’ or ’=’.\n\n\n\n[char set]\nMatch one of the characters specified in the character set. Interpret x-y as the set of characters between range x and y, inclusively. The following escaped characters are interpreted as single special characters: \\n, \\r, \\b, \\t, \\f, \\uXXXX, and \\u{XXXXXX}. To get ] or \\ you must escape them with \\. To get - you must escape it with \\ too, except for the case when - is the first or last character in the set.\n\nYou can also include all characters matching Unicode properties (general category, boolean, or enumerated including scripts and blocks) with \\p{PropertyName} or \\p{EnumProperty=Value}. (You can invert the test with \\P{PropertyName} or \\P{EnumProperty=Value}).\n\nFor a list of valid Unicode property names, see Unicode Standard Annex #44. (ANTLR also supports short and long Unicode general category names and values like \\p{Lu}, \\p{Z}, \\p{Symbol}, \\p{Blk=Latin_1_Sup}, and \\p{Block=Latin_1_Supplement}.)\n\nAs a shortcut for \\p{Block=Latin_1_Supplement}, you can refer to blocks using Unicode block names prefixed with In and with spaces changed to _. For example: \\p{InLatin_1_Supplement}, \\p{InYijing_Hexagram_Symbols}, and \\p{InAncient_Greek_Numbers}.\n\nA few extra properties are supported:\n\n\\p{Extended_Pictographic} (see UTS #35)\n\\p{EmojiPresentation=EmojiDefault} (code points which have colorful emoji-style presentation by default but which can also be displayed text-style)\n\\p{EmojiPresentation=TextDefault} (code points which have black-and-white text-style presentation by default but which can also be displayed emoji-style)\n\\p{EmojiPresentation=Text} (code points which have only black-and-white text-style and lack a colorful emoji-style presentation)\n\n\nProperty names are case-insensitive, and _ and - are treated identically\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n\nWS : [ \\n\\u000D] -> skip ; // same as [ \\n\\r]\n\nUNICODE_WS : [\\p{White_Space}] -> skip; // match all Unicode whitespace\n\nID : [a-zA-Z] [a-zA-Z0-9]* ; // match usual identifier spec\n\nUNICODE_ID : [\\p{Alpha}\\p{General_Category=Other_Letter}] [\\p{Alnum}\\p{General_Category=Other_Letter}]* ; // match full Unicode alphabetic ids\n\nEMOJI : [\\u{1F4A9}\\u{1F926}] ; // note Unicode code points > U+FFFF\n\nDASHBRACK : [\\-\\]]+ ; // match - or ] one or more times\n\nDASH : [---] ; // match a single -, i.e., \"any character\" between - and - (note first and last - not escaped)\n\n\n\n\n\n’x’..’y’\nMatch any single character between range x and y, inclusively. E.g., ’a’..’z’. ’a’..’z’ is identical to [a-z].\n\n\n\nT\nInvoke lexer rule T; recursion is allowed in general, but not left recursion. T can be a regular token or fragment rule.\n\n\nID : LETTER (LETTER|'0'..'9')* ;\n\nfragment\nLETTER : [a-zA-Z\\u0080-\\u00FF_] ;\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nThe dot is a single-character wildcard that matches any single character. Example:\n\nESC : '\\\\' . ; // match any escaped \\x character\n\n\n\n\n\n{«action»}\nLexer actions can appear anywhere as of 4.2, not just at the end of the outermost alternative. The lexer executes the actions at the appropriate input position, according to the placement of the action within the rule. To execute a single action for a rule that has multiple alternatives, you can enclose the alts in parentheses and put the action afterwards:\n\n\nEND : ('endif'|'end') {System.out.println(\"found an end\");} ;\n\n\nThe action conforms to the syntax of the target language. ANTLR copies the action’s contents into the generated code verbatim; there is no translation of expressions like $x.y as there is in parser actions.\n\nOnly actions within the outermost token rule are executed. In other words, if STRING calls ESC_CHAR and ESC_CHAR has an action, that action is not executed when the lexer starts matching in STRING.\n\n\n\n{«p»}?\nEvaluate semantic predicate «p». If «p» evaluates to false at runtime, the surrounding rule becomes “invisible” (nonviable). Expression «p» conforms to the target language syntax. While semantic predicates can appear anywhere within a lexer rule, it is most efficient to have them at the end of the rule. The one caveat is that semantic predicates must precede lexer actions. See Predicates in Lexer Rules.\n\n\n\n~x\nMatch any single character not in the set described by x. Set x can be a single character literal, a range, or a subrule set like ~(’x’|’y’|’z’) or ~[xyz]. Here is a rule that uses ~ to match any character other than characters using ~[\\r\\n]*:\n     \nCOMMENT : '#' ~[\\r\\n]* '\\r'? '\\n' -> skip ;\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as with parser rules, lexer rules allow subrules in parentheses and EBNF operators: ?, *, +. The COMMENT rule illustrates the * and ? operators. A common use of + is [0-9]+ to match integers. Lexer subrules can also use the nongreedy ? suffix on those EBNF operators.\n1.3. Recursive Lexer Rules\nANTLR lexer rules can be recursive, unlike most lexical grammar tools. This comes in really handy when you want to match nested tokens like nested action blocks: {...{...}...}.\nlexer grammar Recur;\n\nACTION : '{' ( ACTION | ~[{}] )* '}' ;\n\nWS : [ \\r\\t\\n]+ -> skip ;\n1.4. Redundant String Literals\nBe careful that you don’t specify the same string literal on the right-hand side of multiple lexer rules. Such literals are ambiguous and could match multiple token types. ANTLR makes this literal unavailable to the parser. The same is true for rules across modes. For example, the following lexer grammar defines two tokens with the same character sequence:\nlexer grammar L;\nAND : '&' ;\nmode STR;\nMASK : '&' ;\nA parser grammar cannot reference literal ’&’, but it can reference the name of the tokens:\nparser grammar P;\noptions { tokenVocab=L; }\na : '&' // results in a tool error: no such token\n    AND // no problem\n    MASK // no problem\n  ;\nHere’s a build and test sequence:\n$ antlr4 L.g4 # yields L.tokens file needed by tokenVocab option in P.g4\n$ antlr4 P.g4\nerror(126): P.g4:3:4: cannot create implicit token for string literal '&' in non-combined grammar\n\n1.5. Lexer Rule Actions\nAn ANTLR lexer creates a Token object after matching a lexical rule. Each request for a token starts in Lexer.nextToken, which calls emit once it has identified a token. emit collects information from the current state of the lexer to build the token. It accesses fields _type, _text, _channel, _tokenStartCharIndex, _tokenStartLine, and _tokenStartCharPositionInLine. You can set the state of these with the various setter methods such as setType. For example, the following rule turns enum into an identifier if enumIsKeyword is false.\nENUM : 'enum' {if (!enumIsKeyword) setType(Identifier);} ;\nANTLR does no special $x attribute translations in lexer actions (unlike v3).\nThere can be at most a single action for a lexical rule, regardless of how many alternatives there are in that rule.\n1.6. Lexer Commands\nTo avoid tying a grammar to a particular target language, ANTLR supports lexer commands. Unlike arbitrary embedded actions, these commands follow specific syntax and are limited to a few common commands. Lexer commands appear at the end of the outermost alternative of a lexer rule definition. Like arbitrary actions, there can only be one per token rule. A lexer command consists of the -> operator followed by one or more command names that can optionally take parameters:\nTokenName : «alternative» -> command-name\nTokenName : «alternative» -> command-name («identifier or integer»)\nAn alternative can have more than one command separated by commas. Here are the valid command names:\n\nskip\nmore\npopMode\nmode( x )\npushMode( x )\ntype( x )\nchannel( x )\n\nSee the book source code for usage, some examples of which are shown here:\n1.6.1. skip\nA 'skip' command tells the lexer to get another token and throw out the current text.\nID : [a-zA-Z]+ ; // match identifiers\nINT : [0-9]+ ; // match integers\nNEWLINE:'\\r'? '\\n' ; // return newlines to parser (is end-statement signal)\nWS : [ \\t]+ -> skip ; // toss out whitespace\n1.6.2. mode(), pushMode(), popMode, and more\nThe mode commands alter the mode stack and hence the mode of the lexer. The 'more' command forces the lexer to get another token but without throwing out the current text. The token type will be that of the \"final\" rule matched (i.e., the one without a more or skip command).\n// Default \"mode\": Everything OUTSIDE of a tag\nCOMMENT : '' ;\nCDATA   : '' ;\nOPEN : ' pushMode(INSIDE) ;\n ...\nXMLDeclOpen : ' pushMode(INSIDE) ;\nSPECIAL_OPEN: ' more, pushMode(PROC_INSTR) ;\n// ----------------- Everything INSIDE of a tag ---------------------\nmode INSIDE;\nCLOSE        : '>' -> popMode ;\nSPECIAL_CLOSE: '?>' -> popMode ; // close \nSLASH_CLOSE  : '/>' -> popMode ;\nAlso check out:\nlexer grammar Strings;\nLQUOTE : '\"' -> more, mode(STR) ;\nWS : [ \\r\\t\\n]+ -> skip ;\nmode STR;\nSTRING : '\"' -> mode(DEFAULT_MODE) ; // token we want parser to see\nTEXT : . -> more ; // collect more text for string\nPopping the bottom layer of a mode stack will result in an exception. Switching modes with mode changes the current stack top.  More than one more is the same as just one and the position does not matter.\n1.6.3. type()\nlexer grammar SetType;\ntokens { STRING }\nDOUBLE : '\"' .*? '\"'   -> type(STRING) ;\nSINGLE : '\\'' .*? '\\'' -> type(STRING) ;\nWS     : [ \\r\\t\\n]+    -> skip ;\nFor multiple 'type()' commands, only the rightmost has an effect.\n1.6.4. channel()\nBLOCK_COMMENT\n    : '/*' .*? '*/' -> channel(HIDDEN)\n    ;\nLINE_COMMENT\n    : '//' ~[\\r\\n]* -> channel(HIDDEN)\n    ;\n... \n// ----------\n// Whitespace\n//\n// Characters and character constructs that are of no import\n// to the parser and are used to make the grammar easier to read\n// for humans.\n//\nWS : [ \\t\\r\\n\\f]+ -> channel(HIDDEN) ;\nAs of 4.5, you can also define channel names like enumerations with the following construct above the lexer rules:\nchannels { WSCHANNEL, MYHIDDEN }\n"},"chapters/wildcard.html":{"url":"chapters/wildcard.html","title":"Wildcard Operator and Nongreedy Subrules","keywords":"","body":"1. Wildcard Operator and Nongreedy Subrules1.1. Nongreedy Lexer Subrules1.2. Nongreedy Parser Subrules1. Wildcard Operator and Nongreedy Subrules\nEBNF subrules like (...)?, (...)* and (...)+ are greedy—They consume as much input as possible, but sometimes that’s not what’s needed. Constructs like .* consume until the end of the input in the lexer and sometimes in the parser. We want that loop to be nongreedy so we need to use different syntax: .*? borrowed from regular expression notation. We can make any subrule that has a ?, *, or + suffix nongreedy by adding another ? suffix. Such nongreedy subrules are allowed in both the parser and the lexer, but they are used much more frequently in the lexer.\n1.1. Nongreedy Lexer Subrules\nHere’s the very common C-style comment lexer rule that consumes any characters until it sees the trailing */:\nCOMMENT : '/*' .*?

'*/' ;\n```\n\n\nNongreedy subrules match the fewest number of characters that still allows the surrounding lexical rule to match.\n\n```\n/** Match anything except \\n inside of double angle brackets */\nSTRING : '>' ; // Input '>>>' matches STRING then END\nEND    : '>>' ;\n```\n\n\nAfter crossing through a nongreedy subrule within a lexical rule, all decision-making from then on is \"first match wins.\"\n\n\nFor example, literal `ab` in rule right-hand side (grammar fragment) `.*? (’a’|’ab’)` is dead code and can never be matched. If the input is ab, the first alternative, ’a’, matches the first character and therefore succeeds. (’a’|’ab’) by itself on the right-hand side of a rule properly matches the second alternative for input ab. This quirk arises from a nongreedy design decision that’s too complicated to go into here.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate the different ways to use loops within lexer rules, consider the following grammar, which has three different action-like tokens (using different delimiters so that they all fit within one example grammar).\nACTION1 : '{' ( STRING | . )*? '}' ; // Allows {\"foo}\nACTION2 : '[' ( STRING | ~'\"' )*? ']' ; // Doesn't allow [\"foo]; nongreedy *?\nACTION3 : '] )* '>' ; // Doesn't allow ; greedy *\nSTRING : '\"' ( '\\\\\"' | . )*? '\"' ;\nRule ACTION1 allows unterminated strings, such as \"foo, because input \"foo matches to the wildcard part of the loop. It doesn’t have to go into rule STRING to match a quote. To fix that, rule ACTION2 uses ~’\"’ to match any character but the quote. Expression ~’\"’ is still ambiguous with the ’]’ that ends the rule, but the fact that the subrule is nongreedy means that the lexer will exit the loop upon a right square bracket. To avoid a nongreedy subrule, make the alternatives explicit. Expression ~[\">] matches anything but the quote and right angle bracket. Here’s a sample run:\n$ antlr4 Actions.g4\n$ javac Actions*.java\n$ grun Actions tokens -tokens\n=>     {\"foo}\n=>     EOF\n,1:0]\n     [@1,7:6='',,2:0]\n=>     $ grun Actions tokens -tokens\n=>     [\"foo]\n=>     EOF\n',,2:0]\n=>     $ grun Actions tokens -tokens\n=>     \n=>     EOF\n\n     '\n     [@0,7:6='',,2:0]\n\n1.2. Nongreedy Parser Subrules\nNongreedy subrules and wildcard are also useful within parsers to do fuzzy parsing where the goal is to extract information from an input file without having to specify the full grammar. In contrast to nongreedy lexer decision-making, parsers always make globally correct decisions. A parser never makes a decision that will ultimately cause valid input to fail later on during the parse. Here is the central idea: Nongreedy parser subrules match the shortest sequence of tokens that preserves a successful parse for a valid input sentence.\nFor example, here are the key rules that demonstrate how to pull integer constants out of an arbitrary Java file:\ngrammar FuzzyJava;\n\n/** Match anything in between constant rule matches */\nfile : .*? (constant .*?)+ ;\n\n/** Faster alternate version (Gets an ANTLR tool warning about\n * a subrule like .* in parser that you can ignore.)\n */\naltfile : (constant | .)* ; // match a constant or any token, 0-or-more times\n\n/** Match things like \"public static final SIZE\" followed by anything */\nconstant\n    :   'public' 'static' 'final' 'int' Identifier\n        {System.out.println(\"constant: \"+$Identifier.text);}\n    ;\n\nIdentifier : [a-zA-Z_$] [a-zA-Z_$0-9]* ; // simplified\nThe grammar contains a greatly simplified set of lexer rules from a real Java lexer; the whole file about 60 lines. The recognizer still needs to handle string and character constants as well as comments so it doesn’t get out of sync, trying to match a constant inside of the string for example. The only unusual lexer rule performs “match any character not matched by another lexer rule” functionality:\nOTHER : . -> skip ;\nThis catchall lexer rule and the .*? subrule in the parser are the critical ingredients for fuzzy parsing.\nHere’s a sample file that we can run into the fuzzy parser:\nimport java.util.*;\npublic class C {\n    public static final int A = 1;\n    public static final int B = 1;\n    public void foo() { }\n    public static final int C = 1;\n}\n\nAnd here’s the build and test sequence:\n$ antlr4 FuzzyJava.g4\n$ javac FuzzyJava*.java\n$ grun FuzzyJava file C.java\nconstant: A\nconstant: B\nconstant: C\n\nNotice that it totally ignores everything except for the public static final int declarations. This all happens with only two parser rules.\nNow let's try matching some simple class defs w/o having to build parser rules for the junk inside.  Here want to catch just A and B:\nclass A {\n        String name = \"parrt\";\n}\n\nclass B {\n        int x;   \n        int getDubX() {\n                return 2*x;\n        }\n}\nThis grammar does it.\ngrammar Island;\nfile : clazz* ;\nclazz : 'class' ID '{' ignore '}' ;\nignore : (method|.)*? ;\nmethod : type ID '()' block ;\ntype : 'int' | 'void' ;\nblock : '{' (block | .)*?

Parse Tree Listeners1. Parse Tree Listeners\nPartially taken from publically visible excerpt from ANTLR 4 book\nBy default, ANTLR-generated parsers build a data structure called a parse tree or syntax tree that records how the parser recognized the structure of the input sentence and component phrases.\n\nThe interior nodes of the parse tree are phrase names that group and identify their children. The root node is the most abstract phrase name, in this case stat (short for statement). The leaves of a parse tree are always the input tokens. Parse trees sit between a language recognizer and an interpreter or translator implementation. They are extremely effective data structures because they contain all of the input and complete knowledge of how the parser grouped the symbols into phrases. Better yet, they are easy to understand and the parser generates them automatically (unless you turn them off with parser.setBuildParseTree(false)).\nBecause we specify phrase structure with a set of rules, parse tree subtree roots correspond to grammar rule names. ANTLR has a ParseTreeWalker that knows how to walk these parse trees and trigger events in listener implementation objects that you can create. The ANTLR tool generates listener interfaces for you also, unless you turn that off with a commandline option. You can also have it generate visitors. For example from a Java.g4 grammar, ANTLR generates:\npublic interface JavaListener extends ParseTreeListener {\n  void enterClassDeclaration(JavaParser.ClassDeclarationContext ctx);\n  void exitClassDeclaration(JavaParser.ClassDeclarationContext ctx);\n  void enterMethodDeclaration(JavaParser.MethodDeclarationContext ctx);\n ...\n}\n\nwhere there is an enter and exit method for each rule in the parser grammar. ANTLR also generates a base listener with the fall empty implementations of all listener interface methods, in this case called JavaBaseListener. You can build your listener by subclassing this base and overriding the methods of interest.\nAssuming you've created a listener object called MyListener, here is how to call the Java parser and walk the parse tree:\nJavaLexer lexer = new JavaLexer(input);\nCommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);\nJavaParser parser = new JavaParser(tokens);\nJavaParser.CompilationUnitContext tree = parser.compilationUnit(); // parse a compilationUnit\n\nMyListener extractor = new MyListener(parser);\nParseTreeWalker.DEFAULT.walk(extractor, tree); // initiate walk of tree with listener in use of default walker\n\nListeners and visitors are great because they keep application-specific code out of grammars, making grammars easier to read and preventing them from getting entangled with a particular application.\nSee the book for more information on listeners and to learn how to use visitors. (The biggest difference between the listener and visitor mechanisms is that listener methods are called independently by an ANTLR-provided walker object, whereas visitor methods must walk their children with explicit visit calls.  Forgetting to invoke visitor methods on a node’s children, means those subtrees don’t get visited.)\n"},"chapters/tree-matching.html":{"url":"chapters/tree-matching.html","title":"Parse Tree Matching and XPath","keywords":"","body":"1. Parse Tree Matching and XPath1.1. Parse tree patterns1.1.1. Pattern labels1.1.2. Creating parse trees with the pattern matcher1.2. Using XPath to identify parse tree node sets1.3. Combining XPath and tree pattern matching1. Parse Tree Matching and XPath\nSince ANTLR 4.2\nANTLR 4 introduced a visitor and listener mechanism that lets you implement DOM visiting or SAX-analogous event processing of tree nodes. This works great. For example, if all you care about is looking at Java method declarations, grab the Java.g4 file and then override methodDeclaration in JavaBaseListener. From there, a ParseTreeWalker can trigger calls to your overridden method as it walks the tree. Easy things are easy.\nThis mechanism works more or less on a node-level basis. In other words, for every method declaration subtree root, your methodDeclaration() would get called. There are many situations where we care more about subtrees not just nodes. We might want to:\n\nCollect method declarations within a particular context (i.e., nested within another method) or methods with specific structure or specific types (e.g., void () { }). We'll combine XPath and tree pattern matching for this.\nGroup translation operations by patterns in the tree rather than spreading operations across listener event methods.\nGet a list of all assignments anywhere in the tree. It's much easier to say go find me all \"... = ... ;\" subtrees rather than creating a class just to get a listener method for rule assignment and then passing the listener to the parse tree walker.\n\nThe other important idea here is that, since we're talking about parse trees not abstract syntax trees, we can use concrete patterns instead of tree syntax. For example, we can say x = 0; instead of AST (= x 0) where the ; would probably stripped before it went into the AST.\n1.1. Parse tree patterns\nTo test a subtree to see if it has a particular structure, we use a tree pattern. We also often want to extract descendents from the subtree based upon the structure. A very simple example is checking to see if a subtree matches an assignment statement. The pattern might look like the following in your language:\n = ;\nwhere \"tags\" in angle brackets represent either token or rule references in the associated grammar. ANTLR converts that string to a parse tree with special nodes that represent any token ID and rule expr subtree. To create this parse tree, the pattern matching compiler needs to know which rule in the grammar the pattern conforms to. In this case it might be statement. Here is how we could test a tree, t, to see if it matches that pattern:\nParseTree t = ...; // assume t is a statement\nParseTreePattern p = parser.compileParseTreePattern(\" = ;\", MyParser.RULE_statement);\nParseTreeMatch m = p.match(t);\nif ( m.succeeded() ) {...}\n\nWe can also test for specific expressions or token values. For example, the following checks to see if t is an expression consisting of an identifier added to 0:\nParseTree t = ...; // assume t is an expression\nParseTreePattern p = parser.compileParseTreePattern(\"+0\", MyParser.RULE_expr);\nParseTreeMatch m = p.match(t);\n\nWe can also ask the ParseTreeMatch result to pull out the token matched to the  tag:\nString id = m.get(\"ID\");\n\nYou can change the tag delimiters using a method on the pattern matcher:\nParseTreePatternMatcher m = new ParseTreePatternMatcher();\nm.setDelimiters(\">\", \"$\"); // $ is the escape character\n\nThis would allow pattern > = > ;$> to be interpreted as elements: ID, =, expr, and ;>.\n1.1.1. Pattern labels\nThe tree pattern matcher tracks the nodes in the tree at matches against the tags in a tree pattern. That way we can use the get() and getAll() methods to retrieve components of the matched subtree. For example, for pattern , get(\"ID\") returns the node matched for that ID. If more than one node matched the specified token or rule tag, only the first match is returned. If there is no node associated with the label, this returns null.\nYou can also label the tags with identifiers. If the label is the name of a parser rule or token in the grammar, the resulting list from getAll() (or node from get()) will contain both the parse trees matching rule or tags explicitly labeled with the label and the complete set of parse trees matching the labeled and unlabeled tags in the pattern for the parser rule or token. For example, if label is foo, the result will contain all of the following.\n\nParse tree nodes matching tags of the form  and .\nParse tree nodes matching tags of the form .\nParse tree nodes matching tags of the form .\n\n1.1.2. Creating parse trees with the pattern matcher\nYou can use the parse tree pattern compiler to create parse trees for partial input fragments. Just use method ParseTreePattern.getPatternTree().\nSee TestParseTreeMatch.java.\n1.2. Using XPath to identify parse tree node sets\nXPath paths are strings representing nodes or subtrees you would like to select within a parse tree. It's useful to collect subsets of the parse tree to process. For example you might want to know where all assignments are in a method or all variable declarations that are initialized.\nA path is a series of node names with the following separators.\n\n\n\nExpression\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnodename\nNodes with the token or rule name nodename\n\n\n/\nThe root node but /X is the same as X since the tree you pass to xpath is assumed to be the root. Because it looks better, start all of your patterns with / (or // below).\n\n\n//\nAll nodes in the tree that match the next element in the path. E.g., //ID finds all ID token nodes in the tree.\n\n\n!\nAny node except for the next element in the path. E.g., /classdef/!field should find all children of classdef root node that are not field subtrees.\n\n\n\nExamples:\n/prog/func, -> all funcs under prog at root\n/prog/*, -> all children of prog at root\n/*/func, -> all func kids of any root node\nprog, -> prog must be root node\n/prog, -> prog must be root node\n/*, -> any root\n*, -> any root\n//ID, -> any ID in tree\n//expr/primary/ID, -> any ID child of a primary under any expr\n//body//ID, -> any ID under a body\n//'return', -> any 'return' literal in tree\n//primary/*, -> all kids of any primary\n//func/*/stat, -> all stat nodes grandkids of any func node\n/prog/func/'def', -> all def literal kids of func kid of prog\n//stat/';', -> all ';' under any stat node\n//expr/primary/!ID, -> anything but ID under primary under any expr node\n//expr/!primary, -> anything but primary under any expr node\n//!*, -> nothing anywhere\n/!*, -> nothing at root\nGiven a parse tree, the typical mechanism for visiting those nodes is the following loop:\nfor (ParseTree t : XPath.findAll(tree, xpath, parser) ) {\n    ... process t ...\n}\n\nE.g., here is a general formula for making a list of the text associated with every node identified by a path specification:\nList nodes = new ArrayList();\nfor (ParseTree t : XPath.findAll(tree, xpath, parser) ) {\n    if ( t instanceof RuleContext) {\n        RuleContext r = (RuleContext)t;\n        nodes.add(parser.getRuleNames()[r.getRuleIndex()]);    }      \n    else { \n        TerminalNode token = (TerminalNode)t;\n        nodes.add(token.getText());\n    }      \n}\n\n1.3. Combining XPath and tree pattern matching\nNaturally you can combine the use of XPath to find a set of root nodes and then use tree pattern matching to identify a certain subset of those and extract component nodes.\n// assume we are parsing Java\nParserRuleContext tree = parser.compilationUnit();\nString xpath = \"//blockStatement/*\"; // get children of blockStatement\nString treePattern = \"int  = ;\";\nParseTreePattern p =\n    parser.compileParseTreePattern(treePattern,   \n        ExprParser.RULE_localVariableDeclarationStatement);\nList matches = p.findAll(tree, xpath);\nSystem.out.println(matches);\n\nSee TestXPath.java.\n"},"chapters/predicates.html":{"url":"chapters/predicates.html","title":"Semantic Predicates","keywords":"","body":"1. Semantic Predicates1.1. Making Predicated Parsing Decisions1.2. Finding Visible Predicates1.3. Using Context-Dependent Predicates1.4. Predicates in Lexer Rules1. Semantic Predicates\nSemantic predicates, {...}?, are boolean expressions written in the target language that indicate the validity of continuing the parse along the path \"guarded\" by the predicate. Predicates can appear anywhere within a parser rule just like actions can, but only those appearing on the left edge of alternatives can affect prediction (choosing between alternatives).  This section provides all of the fine print regarding the use of semantic predicates in parser and lexer rules. Let's start out by digging deeper into how the parser incorporates predicates into parsing decisions.\n1.1. Making Predicated Parsing Decisions\nANTLR's general decision-making strategy is to find all viable alternatives and then ignore the alternatives guarded with predicates that currently evaluate to false. (A viable alternative is one that matches the current input.) If more than one viable alternative remains, the parser chooses the alternative specified first in the decision.\nConsider a variant of C++ where array references also use parentheses instead of square brackets. If we only predicate one of the alternatives, we still have an ambiguous decision in expr:\nexpr: ID '(' expr ')' // array reference (ANTLR picks this one)\n     | {istype()}? ID '(' expr ')' // ctor-style typecast\n     | ID '(' expr ')' // function call\n     ;\nIn this case, all three alternatives are viable for input x(i). When x is not a type name, the predicate evaluates to false, leaving only the first and third alternatives as possible matches for expr. ANTLR automatically chooses the first alternative matching the array reference to resolve the ambiguity. Leaving ANTLR with more than one viable alternative because of too few predicates is probably not a good idea. It's best to cover n viable alternatives with at least n-1 predicates. In other words, don't build rules like expr with too few predicates.\nSometimes, the parser finds multiple visible predicates associated with a single choice. No worries. ANTLR just combines the predicates with appropriate logical operators to conjure up a single meta-predicate on-the-fly.\nFor example, the decision in rule stat joins the predicates from both alternatives of expr with the || operator to guard the second stat alternative:\nstat: decl | expr ;\ndecl: ID ID ;\nexpr: {istype()}? ID '(' expr ')' // ctor-style typecast\n     | {isfunc()}? ID '(' expr ')' // function call\n     ;\nThe parser will only predict an expr from stat when istype()||isfunc() evaluates to true. This makes sense because the parser should only choose to match an expression if the upcoming ID is a type name or function name. It wouldn't make sense to just test one of the predicates in this case. Note that, when the parser gets to expr itself, the parsing decision tests the predicates individually, one for each alternative.\nIf multiple predicates occur in a sequence, the parser joins them with the && operator. For example, consider changing stat to include a predicate before the call toexpr:\nstat: decl | {java5}? expr ;\nNow, the parser would only predict the second alternative if java5&&(istype()||isfunc()) evaluated to true.\nTurning to the code inside the predicates themselves now, keep in mind the following guidelines.\nEven when the parser isn't making decisions, predicates can deactivate alternatives, causing rules to fail. This happens when a rule only has a single alternative. There is no choice to make, but ANTLR evaluates the predicate as part of the normal parsing process, just like it does for actions. That means that the following rule always fails to match.\nprog: {false}? 'return' INT ; // throws FailedPredicateException\nANTLR converts {false}? in the grammar to a conditional in the generated parser:\nif ( !false ) throw new FailedPredicateException(...);\nSo far, all of the predicates we've seen have been visible and available to the prediction process, but that's not always the case.\n1.2. Finding Visible Predicates\nThe parser will not evaluate predicates during prediction that occur after an action or token reference. Let's think about the relationship between actions and predicates first.\nANTLR has no idea what's inside the raw code of an action and so it must assume any predicate could depend on side effects of that action. Imagine an action that computed value x and a predicate that tested x. Evaluating that predicate before the action executed to create x would violate the implied order of operations within the grammar.\nMore importantly, the parser can't execute actions until it has decided which alternative to match. That's because actions have side effects and we can't undo things like print statements. For example, in the following rule, the parser can't execute the action in front of the {java5}? predicate before committing to that alternative.\n@members {boolean allowgoto=false;}\nstat: {System.out.println(\"goto\"); allowgoto=true;} {java5}? 'goto' ID ';'\n     | ...\n     ;\nIf we can't execute the action during prediction, we shouldn't evaluate the {java5}? predicate because it depends on that action.\nThe prediction process also can't see through token references. Token references have the side effect of advancing the input one symbol. A predicate that tested the current input symbol would find itself out of sync if the parser shifted it over the token reference. For example, in the following grammar, the predicates expect getCurrentToken to return an ID token.\nstat: '{' decl '}'\n     | '{' stat '}'\n     ;\ndecl: {istype(getCurrentToken().getText())}? ID ID ';' ;\nexpr: {isvar(getCurrentToken().getText())}? ID ;\nThe decision in stat can't test those predicates because, at the start of stat, the current token is a left curly. To preserve the semantics, ANTLR won't test the predicates in that decision.\nVisible predicates are those that prediction encounters before encountering an action or token. The prediction process ignores nonvisible predicates, treating them as if they don't exist.\nIn rare cases, the parser won't be able to use a predicate, even if it's visible to a particular decision. That brings us to our next fine print topic.\n1.3. Using Context-Dependent Predicates\nA predicate that depends on a parameter or local variable of the surrounding rule, is considered a context-dependent predicate. Clearly, we can only evaluate such predicates within the rules in which they're defined. For example, it makes no sense for the decision in prog below to test context-dependent predicate {$i. That $i local variable is not even defined in prog.\nprog: vec5\n     | ...\n     ;\nvec5\nlocals [int i=1]\n     : ( {$iANTLR ignores context-dependent predicates that it can't evaluate in the proper context. Normally the proper context is simply the rule defining the predicate, but sometimes the parser can't even evaluate a context-dependent predicate from within the same rule! Detecting these cases is done on-the-fly at runtime during adaptive LL(*) prediction.\nFor example, prediction for the optional branch of the else subrule in stat below \"falls off\" the end of stat and continues looking for symbols in the invoking prog rule.\nprog: stat+ ; // stat can follow stat\nstat\nlocals [int i=0]\n     : {$i==0}? 'if' expr 'then' stat {$i=5;} ('else' stat)?\n     | 'break' ';'\n     ;\nThe prediction process is trying to figure out what can follow an if statement other than an else clause. Since the input can have multiple stats in a row, the prediction for the optional branch of the else subrule reenters stat. This time, of course, it gets a new copy of $i with a value of 0, not 5. ANTLR ignores context-dependent predicate {$i==0}? because it knows that the parser isn't in the original stat call. The predicate would test a different version of $i so the parser can't evaluate it.\nThe fine print for predicates in the lexer more or less follow these same guidelines, except of course lexer rules can't have parameters and local variables. Let's look at all of the lexer-specific guidelines in the next section.\n1.4. Predicates in Lexer Rules\nIn parser rules, predicates must appear on the left edge of alternatives to aid in alternative prediction. Lexers, on the other hand, prefer predicates on the right edge of lexer rules because they choose rules after seeing a token's entire text. Predicates in lexer rules can technically be anywhere within the rule. Some positions might be more or less efficient than others; ANTLR makes no guarantees about the optimal spot. A predicate in a lexer rule might be executed multiple times even during a single token match. You can embed multiple predicates per lexer rule and they are evaluated as the lexer reaches them during matching.\nLoosely speaking, the lexer's goal is to choose the rule that matches the most input characters. At each character, the lexer decides which rules are still viable. Eventually, only a single rule will be still viable. At that point, the lexer creates a token object according the rule's token type and matched text.\nSometimes the lexer is faced with more than a single viable matching rule. For example, input enum would match an ENUM rule and an ID rule. If the next character after enum is a space, neither rule can continue. The lexer resolves the ambiguity by choosing the viable rule specified first in the grammar. That's why we have to place keyword rules before an identifier rule like this:\nENUM : 'enum' ;\nID : [a-z]+ ;\nIf, on the other hand, the next character after input enum is a letter, then only ID is viable.\nPredicates come into play by pruning the set of viable lexer rules. When the lexer encounters a false predicate, it deactivates that rule just like parsers deactivate alternatives with false predicates.\nLike parser predicates, lexer predicates can't depend on side effects from lexer actions. That's because actions can only execute after the lexer positively identifies the rule to match. Since predicates are part of the rule selection process, they can't rely on action side effects. Lexer actions must appear after predicates in lexer rules. As an example, here's another way to match enum as a keyword in the lexer:\nENUM: [a-z]+ {getText().equals(\"enum\")}?\n       {System.out.println(\"enum!\");}\n    ;\nID  : [a-z]+ {System.out.println(\"ID \"+getText());} ;\nThe print action in ENUM appears last and executes only if the current input matches [a-z]+ and the predicate is true. Let's build and test Enum3 to see if it distinguishes between enum and an identifier:\n$ antlr4 Enum3.g4\n$ javac Enum3.java\n$ grun Enum3 tokens\n=>     enum abc\n=>     EOF\n\nThat works great, but it's really just for instructional purposes. It's easier to understand and more efficient to match enum keywords with a simple rule like this:\nENUM : 'enum' ;\n"},"chapters/options.html":{"url":"chapters/options.html","title":"Options","keywords":"","body":"1. Options1.1. Grammar Options1.2. Rule Options1.3. Rule Element Options1. Options\nThere are a number of options that you can specify at the grammar and rule element level. (There are currently no rule options.) These change how ANTLR generates code from your grammar. The general syntax is:\noptions { name1=value1; ... nameN=valueN; } // ANTLR not target language syntax\nwhere a value can be an identifier, a qualified identifier (for example, a.b.c), a string, a multi-line string in curly braces {...}, and an integer.\n1.1. Grammar Options\nAll grammars can use the following options. In combined grammars, all options except language pertain only to the generated parser. Options may be set either within the grammar file using the options syntax (described above) or when invoking ANTLR on the command line, using the -D option. (see Section 15.9, ANTLR Tool Command Line Options.) The following examples demonstrate both mechanisms; note that -D overrides options within the grammar.\n\nsuperClass. Set the superclass of the generated parser or lexer. For combined grammars, it sets the superclass of the parser.$ cat Hi.g4\ngrammar Hi;\na : 'hi' ;\n$ antlr4 -DsuperClass=XX Hi.g4\n$ grep 'public class' HiParser.java\npublic class HiParser extends XX {\n$ grep 'public class' HiLexer.java\npublic class HiLexer extends Lexer {\n\nlanguage Generate code in the indicated language, if ANTLR is able to do so. Otherwise, you will see an error message like this:$ antlr4 -Dlanguage=C MyGrammar.g4\nerror(31):  ANTLR cannot generate C code as of version 4.0\n\ntokenVocab ANTLR assigns token type numbers to the tokens as it encounters them in a file. To use different token type values, such as with a separate lexer, use this option to have ANTLR pull in the tokens file. ANTLR generates a tokens file from each grammar.$ cat SomeLexer.g4\nlexer grammar SomeLexer;\nID : [a-z]+ ;\n$ cat R.g4\nparser grammar R;\noptions {tokenVocab=SomeLexer;}\ntokens {A,B,C} // normally, these would be token types 1, 2, 3\na : ID ;\n$ antlr4 SomeLexer.g4\n$ cat SomeLexer.tokens \nID=1\n$ antlr4 R.g4\n$ cat R.tokens\nA=2\nB=3\nC=4\nID=1\n\nTokenLabelType ANTLR normally uses type Token when it generates variables referencing tokens. If you have passed a TokenFactory to your parser and lexer so that they create custom tokens, you should set this option to your specific type.

Rule Options\nThere are currently no valid rule-level options, but the tool still supports the following syntax for future use:\nrulename\noptions {...}\n     : ...\n     ;\n1.3. Rule Element Options\nToken options have the form T as we saw in Section 5.4, Dealing with Precedence, Left Recursion, and Associativity. The only token option is assoc, and it accepts values left and right. Here’s a sample grammar with a left-recursive expression rule that specifies a token option on the ^ exponent operator token:\ngrammar ExprLR;\n\nexpr : expr '^' expr\n     | expr '*' expr // match subexpressions joined with '*' operator\n     | expr '+' expr // match subexpressions joined with '+' operator\n     | INT // matches simple integer atom\n     ;\n\nINT : '0'..'9'+ ;\nWS : [ \\n]+ -> skip ;\nSemantic predicates also accept an option, per Catching failed semantic predicates. The only valid option is the fail option, which takes either a string literal in double-quotes or an action that evaluates to a string. The string literal or string result from the action should be the message to emit upon predicate failure.\nints[int max]\n     locals [int i=1]\n     : INT ( ',' {$i++;} {$i INT )*\n     ;\nThe action can execute a function as well as compute a string when a predicate fails: {...}?\n"},"chapters/tool-options.html":{"url":"chapters/tool-options.html","title":"ANTLR Tool Command Line Options","keywords":"","body":"1.

This option specifies the output directory where ANTLR should generate parsers, listeners, visitors, and tokens files.\n$ antlr4 -o /tmp T.g4\n$ ls /tmp/T*\n/tmp/T.tokens /tmp/TListener.java\n/tmp/TBaseListener.java /tmp/TParser.java\n\n1.2. -lib libdir\nWhen looking for tokens files and imported grammars, ANTLR normally looks in the current directory. This option specifies which directory to look in instead. It is only used for resolving grammar references for the import statement and the tokenVocab option. The path to the primary grammar must always be fully specified.\n$ cat /tmp/B.g4\nparser grammar B;\nx : ID ;\n$ cat A.g4\ngrammar A;\nimport B;\ns : x ;\nID : [a-z]+ ;\n$ antlr4 -lib /tmp A.g4\n1.3. -atn\nGenerate DOT graph files that represent the internal ATN (augmented transition network) data structures that ANTLR uses to represent grammars. The files come out as Grammar.rule .dot. If the grammar is a combined grammar, the lexer rules are named Grammar Lexer.rule .dot.\n$ cat A.g4\ngrammar A;\ns : b ;\nb : ID ;\nID : [a-z]+ ;\n$ antlr4 -atn A.g4\n$ ls *.dot\nA.b.dot A.s.dot ALexer.ID.dot\n1.4. -encoding encodingname\nBy default ANTLR loads grammar files using the UTF-8 encoding, which is a very common character file encoding that degenerates to ASCII for characters that fit in one byte. There are many character file encodings from around the world. If that grammar file is not the default encoding for your locale, you need this option so that ANTLR can properly interpret grammar files. This does not affect the input to the generated parsers, just the encoding of the grammars themselves.\n1.5. -message-format format\nANTLR generates warning and error messages using templates from directory tool/resources/org/antlr/v4/tool/templates/messages/formats. By default, ANTLR uses the antlr.stg (StringTemplate group) file. You can change this to gnu or vs2005 to have ANTLR generate messages appropriate for Emacs or Visual Studio. To make your own called X, create resource org/antlr/v4/tool/templates/messages/formats/ X and place it in the CLASSPATH.\n1.6. -listener\nThis option tells ANTLR to generate a parse tree listener and is the default.\n1.7. -no-listener\nThis option tells ANTLR not to generate a parse tree listener.\n1.8. -visitor\nANTLR does not generate parse tree visitors by default. This option turns that feature on. ANTLR can generate both parse tree listeners and visitors; this option and -listener aren’t mutually exclusive.\n1.9. -no-visitor\nTell ANTLR not to generate a parse tree visitor; this is the default.\n1.10. -package\nUse this option to specify a package or namespace for ANTLR-generated files. Alternatively, you can add a @header {...} action but that ties the grammar to a specific language. If you use this option and @header, make sure that the header action does not contain a package specification otherwise the generated code will have two of them.\n1.11. -depend\nInstead of generating a parser and/or lexer, generate a list of file dependencies, one per line. The output shows what each grammar depends on and what it generates. This is useful for build tools that need to know ANTLR grammar dependencies. Here’s an example:\n$ antlr4 -depend T.g    \nT.g: A.tokens\nTParser.java : T.g\nT.tokens : T.g\nTLexer.java : T.g\nTListener.java : T.g\nTBaseListener.java : T.g\n\nIf you use -lib libdir with -depend and grammar option tokenVocab=A, then the dependencies include the library path as well: T.g: libdir/A.tokens. The output is also sensitive to the -o outdir option: outdir/TParser.java : T.g.\n1.12. -D=value\nUse this option to override or set a grammar-level option in the specified grammar or grammars. This option is useful for generating parsers in different languages without altering the grammar itself. (I expect to have other targets in the near future.)\n$ antlr4 -Dlanguage=Java T.g4 # default\n$ antlr4 -Dlanguage=C T.g4\nerror(31): ANTLR cannot generate C code as of version 4.0b3\n\n1.13. -Werror\nAs part of a large build, ANTLR warning messages could go unnoticed. Turn on this option to have warnings treated as errors, causing the ANTLR tool to report failure back to the invoking commandline shell.\nThere are also some extended options that are useful mainly for debugging ANTLR itself:\n1.14. -Xsave-lexer\nANTLR generates both a parser and a lexer from a combined grammar. To create the lexer, ANTLR extracts a lexer grammar from the combined grammar. Sometimes it’s useful to see what that looks like if it’s not clear what token rules ANTLR is creating. This does not affect the generated parsers or lexers.\n1.15. -XdbgST\nFor those building a code generation target, this option brings up a window showing the generated code and the templates used to generate that code. It invokes the StringTemplate inspector window.\n1.16. -Xforce-atn\nANTLR normally builds traditional “switch on token type” decisions where possible (one token of lookahead is sufficient to distinguish between all alternatives in a decision). To force even these simple decisions into the adaptive LL(*) mechanism, use this option.\n1.17. -Xlog\nThis option creates a log file containing lots of information messages from ANTLR as it processes your grammar. If you would like to see how ANTLR translates your left-recursive rules, turn on this option and look in the resulting log file.\n$ antlr4 -Xlog T.g4     \nwrote ./antlr-2012-09-06-17.56.19.log\n\n1.18. -Xexact-output-dir\n(See the discussion).\nAll output goes into -o dir regardless of paths/package.\n\nOutput -o directory specifier is the exact directory containing the output. Previously it would include the relative path specified on the grammar itself for the purposes of packages.\n\nnew: -o /tmp subdir/T.g4 => /tmp/subdir/T.java\nold: -o /tmp subdir/T.g4 => /tmp/T.java\n\nPreviously we looked for the tokens vocab file in the -lib dir or in the output dir. New: also look in the directory containing the grammar, particularly if it it is specified with a path.\n\n1.18.1. Example for the output directory (4.7)\nHere is the existing 4.7 functionality.\n(For these examples, assume a4.7 and a4.7.1 are aliases to the right version of ANTLR's org.antlr.v4.Tool.)\n$ cd /tmp/parrt\n$ tree\n.\n├── B.g4\n└── src\n    └── pkg\n        └── A.g4\n$ a4.7 -o /tmp/build src/pkg/A.g4\n$ tree /tmp/build\n/tmp/build/\n└── src\n    └── pkg\n        ├── A.tokens\n        ├── ABaseListener.java\n        ├── ALexer.java\n        ├── ALexer.tokens\n        ├── AListener.java\n        └── AParser.java\n\nNow, let's build a grammar that sits in the current directory:\n$ a4.7 -o /tmp/build B.g4\n$ tree /tmp/build\n/tmp/build\n├── B.tokens\n├── BBaseListener.java\n├── BLexer.java\n├── BLexer.tokens\n├── BListener.java\n├── BParser.java\n└── src\n    └── pkg\n        ├── A.tokens\n        ├── ABaseListener.java\n        ├── ALexer.java\n        ├── ALexer.tokens\n        ├── AListener.java\n        └── AParser.java\n\nFinally, if we don't specify the output directory, it paid attention to the relative path specified on the input grammar:\n$ a4.7 src/pkg/A.g4\n$ tree\n.\n├── B.g4\n└── src\n    └── pkg\n        ├── A.g4\n        ├── A.tokens\n        ├── ABaseListener.java\n        ├── ALexer.java\n        ├── ALexer.tokens\n        ├── AListener.java\n        └── AParser.java\n\n1.18.2.

Lexers and Unicode text1.1. Example2. Unicode Code Points in Lexer Grammars2.1. Migration2.1.1. Motivation2.1.2. Legacy grammar using surrogate code units2.1.3. Character Buffering, Unbuffered streams1. Lexers and Unicode text\nPrior to ANTLR 4.7, generated lexers in most targets only supported part of the Unicode standard (code points up to U+FFFF). As of ANTLR 4.7, the lexers in all language runtimes support the full range of Unicode code points up to U+10FFFF. \nC++, Python, Go, and Swift APIs didn't need any API changes to support Unicode code points, so we decided to leave those class interfaces as-is. \nJava, C#, and JavaScript runtimes required changes and, rather than break the previous interface, we deprecated them. (The Java-target deprecated ANTLRInputStream and ANTLRFileStream APIs only support Unicode code points up to U+FFFF.) Now, those targets must create CharStreams from input using CharStreams.fromPath(), CharStreams.fromFileName(), etc... \nA big shout out to Ben Hamilton (github bhamiltoncx) for his superhuman\nefforts across all targets to get true support for U+10FFFF code points.\n1.1. Example\nThe Java, C#, and JavaScript runtimes use the new factory style stream creation interface. For example, here is some sample Java code that uses CharStreams.fromPath():\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n  CharStream charStream = CharStreams.fromPath(Paths.get(args[0]));\n  Lexer lexer = new UnicodeLexer(charStream);\n  CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);\n  tokens.fill();\n  for (Token token : tokens.getTokens()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Got token: \" + token.toString());\n  }\n}\n\n2. Unicode Code Points in Lexer Grammars\nTo refer to Unicode code points\nin lexer grammars, use the \\u string escape plus up to 4 hex digits. For example, to create\na lexer rule for a single Cyrillic character by creating a range from\nU+0400 to U+04FF:\nCYRILLIC : '\\u0400'..'\\u04FF' ; // or [\\u0400-\\u04FF] without quotes\n\nUnicode literals larger than U+FFFF must use the extended \\u{12345} syntax. For example, to create a lexer rule for a selection of smiley faces\nfrom the Emoticons Unicode block:\nEMOTICONS : ('\\u{1F600}' | '\\u{1F602}' | '\\u{1F615}') ; // or [\\u{1F600}\\u{1F602}\\u{1F615}]\n\nFinally, lexer char sets can include Unicode properties. Each Unicode code point has at least one property that describes the type group to which it belongs (e.g. alpha, number, punctuation). Other properties can be the language script or special binary properties and Unicode code blocks. That means however, that a property specifies a group of code points, hence they are only allowed in lexer char sets.\nEMOJI : [\\p{Emoji}] ;\nJAPANESE : [\\p{Script=Hiragana}\\p{Script=Katakana}\\p{Script=Han}] ;\nNOT_CYRILLIC : [\\P{Script=Cyrillic}] ;\n\nSee lexer-rules.md for more detail on Unicode\nescapes in lexer rules.\n2.1. Migration\nCode for 4.6 looked like this:\nCharStream input = new ANTLRFileStream(\"myinputfile\");\nJavaLexer lexer = new JavaLexer(input);\nCommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);\n\n(It didn't use UTF-8 by default, despite the documentation saying so previously; it actually depended on the calling environments default.)\nCode for 4.7 assumes UTF-8 by default and looks like this:\nCharStream input = CharStreams.fromFileName(\"inputfile\");\nJavaLexer lexer = new JavaLexer(input);\nCommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);\n\nOr, if you'd like to specify the file encoding:\nCharStream input = CharStreams.fromFileName(\"inputfile\", Charset.forName(\"windows-1252\"));\n\n2.1.1. Motivation\nAfter a lively discussion, I (parrt) decided not to simply gut the 4.6 ANTLRFileStream and ANTLRInputStream to incorporate the new U+10FFFF functionality. I decided to deprecate the old interface and recommend use of the new interface to prevent confusion. My reasoning is summarized as:\n\nI didn't like the idea of breaking all 4.6 code. To get the previous streams to properly support > 16 bit Unicode would require a lot of changes to the method signatures.\nUsing int buffer element types would double the size of memory required to hold streams in memory, given that we buffer everything (and I didn't want to change that aspect of the streams).\nThe new factory-style interface supports creation of the smallest possible code point buffer element size according to the Unicode code points found in the input stream. This means using half as much memory\nas the old {@link ANTLRFileStream}, which assumed 16-bit characters, for ASCII text.\nThrough some serious testing and performance tweaking, the new streams perform as fast or faster than the 4.6 streams.\n\nWARNING. You should avoid using both the deprecated and the new streams in the same application because you will see \na nontrivial performance degradation. This speed hit is because the \nLexer's internal code goes from a monomorphic to megamorphic\ndynamic dispatch to get characters from the input stream. Java's\non-the-fly compiler (JIT) is unable to perform the same optimizations\nso stick with either the old or the new streams, if performance is\na primary concern. See the extreme debugging and spelunking needed to identify this issue in our timing rig.\n2.1.2. Legacy grammar using surrogate code units\nLegacy grammars that did their own UTF-16 surrogate code unit matching will need to continue to use ANTLRInputStream (Java target) until the parser-application code can upgrade to CharStreams interface. Then the surrogate code unit matching should be removed from the grammar in favor of letting the new streams do the decoding.  \nPrior to 4.7, application code could directly pass Token.getStartIndex() and Token.getStopIndex() to Java and C# String APIs (because both used UTF-16 code units as the fundamental unit of length).  With the new streams, clients will have to convert from code point indices to UTF-16 code unit indices. Here is some (Java) code to show you the necessary logic:\npublic final class CodePointCounter {\n  private final String input;\n  public int inputIndex = 0;\n  public int codePointIndex = 0;\n\n  public int advanceToIndex(int newCodePointIndex) {\n    assert newCodePointIndex >= codePointIndex;\n    while (codePointIndex \n2.1.3. Character Buffering, Unbuffered streams\nThe ANTLR character streams still buffer all the input when you create\nthe stream, as they have done for ~20 years. \nIf you need unbuffered\naccess, please note that it becomes challenging to create\nparse trees. The parse tree has to point to tokens which will either\npoint into a stale location in an unbuffered stream or you have to copy\nthe characters out of the buffer into the token. That defeats the purpose\nof unbuffered input. See the ANTLR 4 book \"13.8 Unbuffered Character and Token Streams\". Unbuffered streams are primarily\nuseful for processing infinite streams during the parse and require that you manually buffer characters. Use UnbufferedCharStream and UnbufferedTokenStream.\nCharStream input = new UnbufferedCharStream(is);\nCSVLexer lex = new CSVLexer(input); // copy text out of sliding buffer and store in tokens\nlex.setTokenFactory(new CommonTokenFactory(true));\nTokenStream tokens = new UnbufferedTokenStream(lex);\nCSVParser parser = new CSVParser(tokens);\nparser.setBuildParseTree(false);\nparser.file();\n\nYour grammar that needs to have embedded actions that access the tokens as they are created, but before they disappear and are garbage collected. For example,\ndata : a=INT {int x = Integer.parseInt($a.text);} ;\nFrom the code comments of CommonTokenFactory:\n\nThat true in new CommonTokenFactory(true) indicates whether CommonToken.setText should be called after \nconstructing tokens to explicitly set the text. This is useful for cases\nwhere the input stream might not be able to provide arbitrary substrings\nof text from the input after the lexer creates a token (e.g. the\nimplementation of CharStream.getText in\nUnbufferedCharStream throws an\nUnsupportedOperationException). Explicitly setting the token text\nallows Token.getText to be called at any time regardless of the\ninput stream implementation.\n\nCurrently, only Java, C++, and C# have these unbuffered streams implemented.\n"},"chapters/parsing-binary-files.html":{"url":"chapters/parsing-binary-files.html","title":"Parsing binary streams","keywords":"","body":"1. Parsing Binary Files1.1. Binary streams1.2. Custom stream1.3. Error handling in binary files1. Parsing Binary Files\nParsing binary files is no different than parsing character-based files except that the \"characters\" are actually bytes not 16-bit unsigned short unicode characters.  From a lexer/parser point of view, there is no difference except that the characters are likely not printable.  If you want to match a special 2-byte marker 0xCA then 0xFE, the following rule is sufficient.\nMARKER : '\\u00CA' '\\u00FE' ;\nThe parser of course would refer to that token like any other token.\nHere is a sample grammar for use with the code snippets below.\ngrammar IP;\n\nfile : ip+ (MARKER ip)* ;\n\nip : BYTE BYTE BYTE BYTE ;\n\nMARKER : '\\u00CA' '\\u00FE' ;\nBYTE : '\\u0000'..'\\u00FF' ;\nNotice that BYTE is using a range operator to match anything between 0 and 255. We can't use character classes like [a-z] naturally because we are not parsing character codes.  All character specifiers must have 00 as their upper byte. E.g., \\uCAFE is not a valid character because that 16-bit value will never be created from the input stream (bytes only remember).\nIf there are actual characters like $ or ! encoded as bytes in the binary file, you can refer to them via literals like '$' as you normally would. See '.' in the grammar.\n1.1. Binary streams\nThere are many targets now so I'm not sure exactly how they process text files but most targets will pull in text per the machine's locale. Much of the time this will mean UTF-8 encoding of text converted to 16-bit Unicode. ANTLR's lexers operate on int so we can handle any kind of character you want to send in that fits in int.\nOnce the lexer gets an input stream, it doesn't care whether the characters come from / represent bytes or actual Unicode characters.\nLet's get a binary file called ips and put it in our resources directory:\npublic class WriteBinaryFile {\n    public static final byte[] bytes = {\n        (byte)172, 0, 0, 1, (byte)0xCA, (byte)0xFE,\n        (byte)10, 10, 10, 1, (byte)0xCA, (byte)0xFE,\n        (byte)10, 10, 10, 99\n    };\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        Files.write(new File(\"/tmp/ips\").toPath(), bytes);\n    }\n}\n\nNow we need to create a stream of bytes satisfactory to ANTLR, which is as simple as:\nCharStream bytesAsChar = CharStreams.fromFileName(\"/tmp/ips\", StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1);\n\nThe ISO-8859-1 encoding is just the 8-bit char encoding for LATIN-1, which effectively tells the stream to treat each byte as a character. That's what we want. Then we have the usual test rig:\n//ANTLRFileStream bytesAsChar = new ANTLRFileStream(\"/tmp/ips\", \"ISO-8859-1\"); DEPRECATED in 4.7\nCharStream bytesAsChar = CharStreams.fromFileName(\"/tmp/ips\", StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1);\nIPLexer lexer = new IPLexer(bytesAsChar);\nCommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);\nIPParser parser = new IPParser(tokens);\nParseTree tree = parser.file();\nIPBaseListener listener = new MyIPListener();\nParseTreeWalker.DEFAULT.walk(listener, tree);\n\nHere is the listener:\nclass MyIPListener extends IPBaseListener {\n    @Override\n    public void exitIp(IPParser.IpContext ctx) {\n        List octets = ctx.BYTE();\n        short[] ip = new short[4];\n        for (int i = 0; i\nWe can't just print out the text because we are not reading in text. We need to emit each byte as a decimal value. The output should be the following when you run the test code:\n[172, 0, 0, 1]\n[10, 10, 10, 1]\n[10, 10, 10, 99]\n1.2. Custom stream\n(ANTLRFileStream was deprecated in 4.7)\nIf you want to play around with the stream, you can. Here's an example that alters how \"text\" is computed from the byte stream (which changes how tokens print out their text as well):\n/** make a stream treating file as full of single unsigned byte characters */\nclass BinaryANTLRFileStream extends ANTLRFileStream {\n    public BinaryANTLRFileStream(String fileName) throws IOException {\n        super(fileName, \"ISO-8859-1\");\n    }\n\n    /** Print the decimal value rather than treat as char */\n    @Override\n    public String getText(Interval interval) {\n        StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();\n        int start = interval.a;\n        int stop = interval.b;\n        if(stop >= this.n) {\n            stop = this.n - 1;\n        }\n\n        for (int i = start; i\nThe new test code starts out like this:\nANTLRFileStream bytesAsChar = new BinaryANTLRFileStream(\"/tmp/ips\");\nIPLexer lexer = new IPLexer(bytesAsChar);\n...\n\nThis simplifies our listener then:\nclass MyIPListenerCustomStream extends IPBaseListener {\n    @Override\n    public void exitIp(IPParser.IpContext ctx) {\n        List octets = ctx.BYTE();\n        System.out.println(octets);\n    }\n}\n\nYou should get this enhanced output:\n[172(0xAC), 0(0x0), 0(0x0), 1(0x1)]\n[10(0xA), 10(0xA), 10(0xA), 1(0x1)]\n[10(0xA), 10(0xA), 10(0xA), 99(0x63)]\n1.3. Error handling in binary files\nError handling proceeds exactly like any other parser. For example, let's alter the binary file so that it is missing one of the 0's in the first IP address:\npublic static final byte[] bytes = {\n    (byte)172, 0, 1, (byte)0xCA, (byte)0xFE, // OOOPS\n    (byte)10, 10, 10, 1, (byte)0xCA, (byte)0xFE,\n    (byte)10, 10, 10, 99\n};\n\nRunning the original test case gives us:\nline 1:4 extraneous input '.' expecting BYTE\nline 1:6 mismatched input 'Êþ' expecting '.'\n[172, 0, 1, 0]\n[10, 10, 10, 1]\n[10, 10, 10, 99]\nThat 'Êþ' is just to the character representation of two bytes 0xCA and 0xFE. Using the enhanced binary stream, we see:\nline 1:4 extraneous input '46(0x2E)' expecting BYTE\nline 1:6 mismatched input '202(0xCA)254(0xFE)' expecting '.'\n[172(0xAC), 0(0x0), 1(0x1)]\n[10(0xA), 10(0xA), 10(0xA), 1(0x1)]\n[10(0xA), 10(0xA), 10(0xA), 99(0x63)]\n"},"chapters/case-insensitive-lexing.html":{"url":"chapters/case-insensitive-lexing.html","title":"Case-Insensitive Lexing","keywords":"","body":"1. Case-Insensitive Lexing1.1. Case-insensitive grammars1.2. Custom character streams approach1. Case-Insensitive Lexing\nIn some languages, keywords are case insensitive meaning that BeGiN means the same thing as begin or BEGIN. ANTLR has two mechanisms to support building grammars for such languages:\n\nBuild lexical rules that match either upper or lower case.\n\nAdvantage: no changes required to ANTLR, makes it clear in the grammar that the language in this case insensitive.\nDisadvantage: might have a small efficiency cost and grammar is a more verbose and more of a hassle to write.\n\n\nBuild lexical rules that match keywords in all uppercase and then parse with a custom character stream that converts all characters to uppercase before sending them to the lexer (via the LA() method). Care must be taken not to convert all characters in the stream to uppercase because characters within strings and comments should be unaffected. All we really want is to trick the lexer into thinking the input is all uppercase.\n\nAdvantage: Could have a speed advantage depending on implementation, no change required to the grammar.\nDisadvantage: Requires that the case-insensitive stream and grammar are used in correctly in conjunction with each other, makes all characters appear as uppercase/lowercase to the lexer but some grammars are case sensitive outside of keywords, errors new case insensitive streams and language output targets (java, C#, C++, ...).\n\n\n\nFor the 4.7.1 release, we discussed both approaches in detail and even possibly altering the ANTLR metalanguage to directly support case-insensitive lexing. We discussed including the case insensitive streams into the runtime but not all would be immediately supported. I decided to simply make documentation that clearly states how to handle this and include the appropriate snippets that people can cut-and-paste into their grammars.\n1.1. Case-insensitive grammars\nAs a prime example of a grammar that specifically describes case insensitive keywords, see the\nSQLite grammar.  To match a case insensitive keyword, there are rules such as\nK_UPDATE : U P D A T E;\nthat will match UpdaTE and upDATE etc... as the update keyword. This rule makes use of some generically useful fragment rules that you can cut-and-paste into your grammars:\nfragment A : [aA]; // match either an 'a' or 'A'\nfragment B : [bB];\nfragment C : [cC];\nfragment D : [dD];\nfragment E : [eE];\nfragment F : [fF];\nfragment G : [gG];\nfragment H : [hH];\nfragment I : [iI];\nfragment J : [jJ];\nfragment K : [kK];\nfragment L : [lL];\nfragment M : [mM];\nfragment N : [nN];\nfragment O : [oO];\nfragment P : [pP];\nfragment Q : [qQ];\nfragment R : [rR];\nfragment S : [sS];\nfragment T : [tT];\nfragment U : [uU];\nfragment V : [vV];\nfragment W : [wW];\nfragment X : [xX];\nfragment Y : [yY];\nfragment Z : [zZ];\nNo special streams are required to use this mechanism for case insensitivity.\n1.2. Custom character streams approach\nThe other approach is to use lexical rules that match either all uppercase or all lowercase, such as:\nK_UPDATE : 'UPDATE';\nThen, when creating the character stream to parse from, we need a custom class that overrides methods used by the lexer. Below you will find custom character streams for a number of the targets that you can copy into your projects, but here is how to use the streams in Java as an example:\nCharStream s = CharStreams.fromPath(Paths.get('test.sql'));\nCaseChangingCharStream upper = new CaseChangingCharStream(s, true);\nLexer lexer = new SomeSQLLexer(upper);\n\nHere are implementations of CaseChangingCharStream in various target languages:\n\nC#\nDart\nGo\nJava\nJavaScript\nPython2/3\n\n"},"chapters/interpreters.html":{"url":"chapters/interpreters.html","title":"Parser and lexer interpreters","keywords":"","body":"1. Parser and Lexer Interpreters1.1. Action Code1.2. Java Target Interpreter Setup1.3. Non-Java Target Interpreter Setup1. Parser and Lexer Interpreters\nSince ANTLR 4.2\nFor small parsing tasks it is sometimes convenient to use ANTLR in interpreted mode, rather than generating a parser in a particular target, compiling it and running it as part of your application. Here's some sample code that creates lexer and parser Grammar objects and then creates interpreters. Once we have a ParserInterpreter, we can use it to parse starting in any rule we like, given a rule index (which the grammar + the parser can provide).\n1.1. Action Code\nSince interpreters don't use generated parsers + lexers they cannot execute any action code (including predicates). That means the interpreter runs as if there were no predicates at all. If your grammar requires action code in order to parse correctly you will not be able to test it using this approach.\n1.2. Java Target Interpreter Setup\nLexerGrammar lg = new LexerGrammar(\n    \"lexer grammar L;\\n\" +\n    \"A : 'a' ;\\n\" +\n    \"B : 'b' ;\\n\" +\n    \"C : 'c' ;\\n\");\nGrammar g = new Grammar(\n    \"parser grammar T;\\n\" +\n    \"s : (A|B)* C ;\\n\",\n    lg);   \nLexerInterpreter lexEngine =\n    lg.createLexerInterpreter(new ANTLRInputStream(input));\nCommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexEngine);\nParserInterpreter parser = g.createParserInterpreter(tokens);\nParseTree t = parser.parse(g.rules.get(startRule).index);\n\nYou can also load combined grammars from a file:\npublic static ParseTree parse(String fileName,\n                              String combinedGrammarFileName,\n                              String startRule)\n    throws IOException\n{\n    final Grammar g = Grammar.load(combinedGrammarFileName);\n    LexerInterpreter lexEngine = g.createLexerInterpreter(CharStreams.fromPath(Paths.get(fileName)));\n    CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexEngine);\n    ParserInterpreter parser = g.createParserInterpreter(tokens);\n    ParseTree t = parser.parse(g.getRule(startRule).index);\n    System.out.println(\"parse tree: \"+t.toStringTree(parser));\n    return t;\n}\n\nThen:\nParseTree t = parse(\"T.om\",\n                    MantraGrammar,\n                    \"compilationUnit\");\n\nTo load separate lexer/parser grammars, do this:\npublic static ParseTree parse(String fileNameToParse,\n                              String lexerGrammarFileName,\n                              String parserGrammarFileName,\n                              String startRule)\n    throws IOException\n{\n    final LexerGrammar lg = (LexerGrammar) Grammar.load(lexerGrammarFileName);\n    final Grammar pg = Grammar.load(parserGrammarFileName, lg);\n    CharStream input = CharStreams.fromPath(Paths.get(fileNameToParse));\n    LexerInterpreter lexEngine = lg.createLexerInterpreter(input);\n    CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexEngine);\n    ParserInterpreter parser = pg.createParserInterpreter(tokens);\n    ParseTree t = parser.parse(pg.getRule(startRule).index);\n    System.out.println(\"parse tree: \" + t.toStringTree(parser));\n    return t;\n}\n\nThen:\nParseTree t = parse(fileName, XMLLexerGrammar, XMLParserGrammar, \"document\");\n\nThis is also how we will integrate instantaneous parsing into ANTLRWorks2 and development environment plug-ins.\nSee TestParserInterpreter.java.\n1.3. Non-Java Target Interpreter Setup\nThe ANTLR4 runtimes do not contain any grammar parsing classes (they are in the ANTLR4 tool  jar). Hence we cannot use LexerGrammar and Grammar to parse grammars for the interpreter. Instead we directly instantiate LexerInterpreter and ParserInterpreter objects. They require some data (namely symbol information and the ATNs) which only the ANTLR4 tool can give us. However, on each generation run ANTLR not only produces your parser + lexer files but also interpreter data files (*.interp) which contain all you need to feed the interpreters.\nA support class (InterpreterDataReader) is used to load the data for your convenience, which makes this very easy to use. Btw. even the Java target go this route instead of using the non-runtime classes Grammar and LexerGrammar. Sometimes it might not be feasible to use the tool jar for whatever reason.\nHere's how the setup looks like (C++ example):\n/**\n * sourceFileName - name of the file with content to parse\n * lexerName - the name of your lexer (arbitrary, that's what is used in error messages)\n * parserName - ditto for the parser\n * lexerDataFileName - the lexer interpeter data file name (e.g. `/ExprLexer.interp`)\n * parserDataFileName - ditto for the parser (e.g. `/Expr.interp`)\n * startRule - the name of the rule to start parsing at\n */\nvoid parse(std::string const& sourceFileName,\n  std::string const& lexerName, std::string const& parserName,\n  std::string const& lexerDataFileName, std::string const& parserDataFileName,\n  std::string const& startRule) {\n\n    InterpreterData lexerData = InterpreterDataReader::parseFile(lexerDataFileName);\n    InterpreterData parserData = InterpreterDataReader::parseFile(parserDataFileName);\n\n    ANTLRFileStream input(sourceFileName);\n    LexerInterpreter lexEngine(lexerName, lexerData.vocabulary, lexerData.ruleNames,\n      lexerData.channels, lexerData.modes, lexerData.atn, &input);\n    CommonTokenStream tokens(&lexEngine);\n\n    /* Remove comment to print the tokens.\n    tokens.fill();\n    std::cout toString() toStringTree(&parser) \n"},"chapters/resources.html":{"url":"chapters/resources.html","title":"Resources","keywords":"","body":"1.

If you would like to fork the project and fix bugs or tweak the runtime code generation, then you will almost certainly need to build ANTLR itself.

Get the source\nThe first step is to get the Java source code from the ANTLR 4 repository at github. You can download the repository from github, but the easiest thing to do is simply clone the repository on your local disk:\n$ cd /tmp\n/tmp $ git clone https://github.com/antlr/antlr4.git\nCloning into 'antlr4'...\nremote: Counting objects: 61480, done.\nremote: Total 61480 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 61480\nReceiving objects: 100% (61480/61480), 31.24 MiB | 7.18 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (32970/32970), done.\nChecking connectivity... done.\nChecking out files: 100% (1427/1427), done.\n\n3.

CSharp\nNow we have appveyor create artifact. Go to nuget to upload the .nupkg.\n1.8.3. Publishing to Nuget from Windows\nInstall the pre-requisites\nOf course you need Mono and nuget to be installed. On mac:\n\n.NET build tools - can be loaded from here (I need dotnet 5 and 3.1 versions)\nnuget - download nuget.exe\ndotnet - follow the instructions here\n\nFrom @kvanTTT: Install dotnet on any platform (see https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and run the following command on any OS (Win, Linux, macOS):\n\nbuilding: dotnet build runtime/CSharp/src/Antlr4.csproj -c Release\nOutput .dll will be in runtime/CSharp/src/bin/Release/netstandard2.0 or in runtime/CSharp/src/bin/Release/netstandard2.1\npacking: dotnet pack runtime/CSharp/src/Antlr4.csproj -c Release\nOutput .nupkg will be in runtime/CSharp/src/bin/Release/Antlr4.Runtime.Standard.4.9.1.nupkg\n\nAlternatively, you can install Visual Studio 2017 and make sure to check boxes with .NET Core SDK.\nYou also need to enable .NET Framework 3.5 support in Windows \"Programs and Features\".\nIf everything is ok, the following command will restore nuget packages, build Antlr for .NET Standard and .NET 3.5 and create nuget package:\nmsbuild /target:restore /target:rebuild /target:pack /property:Configuration=Release .\\Antlr4.dotnet.sln /verbosity:minimal\n\nThis should display something like this: \nCreating and packaging the assembly\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 15.4.8.50001 for .NET Framework\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

You need to get your NuGet key from https://www.nuget.org/account# and then from the cmd line, you can then type:\nnuget push Antlr4.Runtime.Standard..nupkg  -Source https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package\n\nNuget packages are also accessible as artifacts of AppVeyor builds. \n1.8.4. Python\nThe Python targets get deployed with setup.py. First, set up ~/.pypirc with tight privileges:\nbeast:~ $ ls -l ~/.pypirc\n-rw-------  1 parrt  staff  267 Jul 15 17:02 /Users/parrt/.pypirc\n\n[distutils] # this tells distutils what package indexes you can push to\nindex-servers =\n    pypi\n    pypitest\n\n[pypi]\nusername: parrt\npassword: xxx\n\n[pypitest]\nusername: parrt\npassword: xxx\nThen run the usual python set up stuff:\ncd ~/antlr/code/antlr4/runtime/Python2\n# assume you have ~/.pypirc set up\npython2 setup.py sdist upload\n\nand do again for Python 3 target\ncd ~/antlr/code/antlr4/runtime/Python3\n# assume you have ~/.pypirc set up\npython3 setup.py sdist upload\n\nThere are links to the artifacts in download.html already.\n1.8.5. C++\nThe C++ target is the most complex one, because it addresses multiple platforms, which require individual handling. We have 4 scenarios to cover:\n\nWindows: static and dynamic libraries for the VC++ runtime 2017 or 2019 (corresponding to Visual Studio 2017 or 2019) + header files. All that in 32 and 64bit, debug + release.\nMacOS: static and dynamic release libraries + header files.\niOS: no prebuilt binaries, but just a zip of the source, including the XCode project to build everything from source.\nLinux: no prebuilt binaries, but just a zip of the source code, including the cmake file to build everything from source there.\n\nIn theory we could also create a library for iOS, but that requires to sign it, which depends on an active iOS developer account. So we leave this up to the ANTLR user to build the iOS lib, like we do for Linux builds.\nFor each platform there's a deployment script which generates zip archives and copies them to the target folder. The Windows deployment script must be run on a machine with VS 2013 + VS 2015 installed. The Mac script must be run on a machine with XCode 7+ installed. The source script can be executed on any Linux or Mac box.\nOn a Mac (with XCode 7+ installed):\ncd runtime/Cpp\n./deploy-macos.sh\ncp antlr4-cpp-runtime-macos.zip ~/antlr/sites/website-antlr4/download/antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9-macos.zip\n\nOn any Mac or Linux machine:\ncd runtime/Cpp\n./deploy-source.sh\ncp antlr4-cpp-runtime-source.zip ~/antlr/sites/website-antlr4/download/antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9-source.zip\n\nOn a Windows machine the build scripts checks if VS 2017 and/or VS 2019 are installed and builds binaries for each, if found. This script requires 7z to be installed (http://7-zip.org then do set PATH=%PATH%;C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\ from DOS not powershell).\ncd runtime/Cpp\ndeploy-windows.cmd Community\ncp antlr4-cpp-runtime-vs2019.zip ~/antlr/sites/website-antlr4/download/antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9-vs2019.zip\n\nMove target to website (rename to a specific ANTLR version first if needed):\npushd ~/antlr/sites/website-antlr4/download\n# vi index.html\ngit add antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9-macos.zip\ngit add antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9-windows.zip\ngit add antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9-source.zip\ngit commit -a -m 'update C++ runtime'\ngit push origin gh-pages\npopd\n\n1.8.6.

ANTLR project unit tests\n1.1. Introduction\nBecause ANTLR supports multiple target languages, the unit tests are broken into two groups: the unit tests that test the tool itself (in tool-testsuite) and the unit tests that test the parser runtimes (in antlr4/runtime-testsuite).  The tool tests are straightforward because they are Java code testing Java code; see the section at the bottom of this file.\nThe runtime tests must be specified in a generic fashion to work across language targets. Furthermore, we must test the various targets from Java. This usually means Java launching processes to compile, say, C++ and run parsers.\nAs of 4.6, we use a Java descriptor object to describe each runtime test.  Unit tests are grouped together into categories such as ParserExecDescriptors, which has multiple nested descriptor objects, one per test. For example, here is the start of that file:\npublic class ParserExecDescriptors {\n    public static class APlus extends BaseParserTestDescriptor {\n        public String input = \"a b c\";\n        public String output = \"abc\\n\";\n        public String errors = \"\";\n        public String startRule = \"a\";\n        public String grammarName = \"T\";\n\n        /**\n         grammar T;\n         a : ID+ {\n         \n         };\n         ID : 'a'..'z'+;\n         WS : (' '|'\\n') -> skip;\n         */\n        @CommentHasStringValue\n        public String grammar;\n    }\n\nThe mysterious @CommentHasStringValue annotation is a bit of a hack that allows multi-line strings in Java. This kung fu is required so that we can use Java classes rather than StringTemplate group files to specify runtime tests (the legacy system used those and it was hard to get them right). Here are all the Runtime test descriptors organized into groups.\nThe grammars are strings representing StringTemplates (ST objects) so  will get replace when the unit test file is generated (Test.java, Test.cs, ...). The writeln template must be defined per target.  Here are all of the \nTarget templates for runtime tests.\n1.2. Requirements\nIn order to perform the tests on all target languages, you need to have the following languages installed:\n\nmono (e.g., brew install mono) on non-Windows boxes (on Windows it uses the Microsoft .net stack). Also must xbuild the runtime before tests will run; see below\nnodejs\nPython 2.7\nPython 3.6\nGo\nSwift 4 (via XCode 10.x) tested currently only osx\nclang (for C++ target) \nTo install into local repository ~/.m2/repository/org/antlr, do this:\n\n$ export MAVEN_OPTS=\"-Xmx1G\"     # don't forget this on linux\n$ mvn install -DskipTests=true   # make sure all artifacts are visible on this machine\n\nNow, make sure C# runtime is built and installed locally.\ncd ~/antlr/code/antlr4/runtime/CSharp/src\nrm -rf `find . -name '{obj,bin}'`\ndotnet build -c Release runtime/CSharp/src/Antlr4.csproj\n\nC++ test rig automatically builds C++ runtime during tests. Others don't need a prebuilt lib.\n1.3. Running the runtime tests\nA single test rig is sufficient to test all targets against all descriptors using the junit parameterized tests mechanism. But, that is inconvenient because we often want to test just a single target or perhaps even just a single test within a single group of a single target. I have automatically generated a bunch of\nTarget runtime test rigs that allow developers such flexibility. For example, here are the Python3 test rigs in intellij:\n\nAnd the result of testing the entire subdirectory:\n\nFrom mvn, on the commandline, you will see:\n$ cd antlr4\n$ mvn test\n...\n-------------------------------------------------------\n T E S T S\n-------------------------------------------------------\nRunning org.antlr.v4.test.runtime.csharp.TestCompositeLexers\ndir /var/folders/s1/h3qgww1x0ks3pb30l8t1wgd80000gn/T/TestCompositeLexers-1446068612451\nStarting build /usr/bin/xbuild /p:Configuration=Release /var/folders/s1/h3qgww1x0ks3pb30l8t1wgd80000gn/T/TestCompositeLexers-1446068612451/Antlr4.Test.mono.csproj\ndir /var/folders/s1/h3qgww1x0ks3pb30l8t1wgd80000gn/T/TestCompositeLexers-1446068615081\nStarting build /usr/bin/xbuild /p:Configuration=Release /var/folders/s1/h3qgww1x0ks3pb30l8t1wgd80000gn/T/TestCompositeLexers-1446068615081/Antlr4.Test.mono.csproj\nTests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3.451 sec\nRunning org.antlr.v4.test.runtime.csharp.TestCompositeParsers\ndir /var/folders/s1/h3qgww1x0ks3pb30l8t1wgd80000gn/T/TestCompositeParsers-1446068615864\nantlr reports warnings from [-visitor, -Dlanguage=CSharp, -o, /var/folders/s1/h3qgww1x0ks3pb30l8t1wgd80000gn/T/TestCompositeParsers-1446068615864, -lib, /var/folders/s1/h3qgww1x0ks3pb30l8t1wgd80000gn/T/TestCompositeParsers-1446068615864, -encoding, UTF-8, /var/folders/s1/h3qgww1x0ks3pb30l8t1wgd80000gn/T/TestCompositeParsers-1446068615864/M.g4]\n...\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\n[INFO] \n[INFO] ANTLR 4 ............................................

Then, add a new RuntimeTestDescriptor implementation by subclassing one of:\n\nBaseParserTestDescriptor; see example APlus.\nBaseDiagnosticParserTestDescriptor if you want to test parser diagnostic output; see example output.\nBaseCompositeParserTestDescriptor; see example BringInLiteralsFromDelegate\nBaseLexerTestDescriptor; see example ActionPlacement.\nBaseCompositeLexerTestDescriptor; see example LexerDelegatorInvokesDelegateRule\n\nEach descriptor object describes the following mandatory elements for the test:\n\nthe test type\nthe grammar \nthe start rule\nthe input text to parse or lex\nthe expected output\nthe expected errors\n\nYour best bet is to find a similar test in the appropriate group and then copy and paste the descriptor object, creating a new nested class within the test group class. Modify the field definitions to suit your new problem.\nIf you need to create a whole new group of tests, it requires a new descriptor class; call it XDescriptors. Then, in each target subdirectory, you need to create a new test rig TestX.java file:\npackage org.antlr.v4.test.runtime.java;\n\nimport org.antlr.v4.test.runtime.BaseRuntimeTest;\nimport org.antlr.v4.test.runtime.RuntimeTestDescriptor;\nimport org.antlr.v4.test.runtime.descriptors.ListenersDescriptors;\nimport org.junit.runner.RunWith;\nimport org.junit.runners.Parameterized;\n\n@RunWith(Parameterized.class)\npublic class TestX extends BaseRuntimeTest {\n    public TestX(RuntimeTestDescriptor descriptor) {\n        super(descriptor,new BaseTest());\n    }\n\n    @Parameterized.Parameters(name=\"{0}\")\n    public static RuntimeTestDescriptor[] getAllTestDescriptors() {\n        return BaseRuntimeTest.getRuntimeTestDescriptors(XDescriptors.class, \"\");\n    }\n}\n\nwhere  is replaced with Java, Cpp, CSharp, Python2, ... in the various subdirectories.\n1.6.1. Ignoring tests\nIn order to turn off a test for a particular target, we need to use the ignore method. Given a target name, a descriptor object can decide whether to ignore the test. This is not always convenient but it is fully general and works well for the one case we have now where we have to ignore Visitor tests in all targets except JavaScript.\n1.6.2. Target API/library testing\nSome parts of the runtime API need to be tested with code written specifically in the target language. For example, you can see all of the Java runtime API tests here:\nhttps://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/master/runtime-testsuite/test/org/antlr/v4/test/runtime/java/api\nNotice that it is under an api dir. The directory above is where all of the Test* files go.\n1.6.3. Cross-language actions embedded within grammars\nTo get:\nSystem.out.println($set.stop);\nUse instead the language-neutral:\n\nTemplate file runtime-testsuite/resources/org/antlr/v4/test/runtime/templates/Java.test.stg has templates like:\nwriteln(s) ::= );>>\nthat translate generic operations to target-specific language statements or expressions.\n1.7. Adding an ANTLR tool unit test\nJust go into the appropriate Java test class in dir antlr4/tool-testsuite/test/org/antlr/v4/test/tool and add your unit test.\n"},"chapters/creating-a-language-target.html":{"url":"chapters/creating-a-language-target.html","title":"Creating an ANTLR Language Target","keywords":"","body":"1. Creating an ANTLR Language Target1.1. Overview1.2. Getting started1. Creating an ANTLR Language Target\nThis document describes how to make ANTLR generate parsers in a new language, X.\n1.1. Overview\nCreating a new target involves the following key elements:\n\nFor the tool, create class XTarget as a subclass of class Target in package org.antlr.v4.codegen.target. This class describes language specific details about escape characters and strings and so on. There is very little to do here typically.\nCreate X.stg in directory tool/resources/org/antlr/v4/tool/templates/codegen/X/X.stg. This is a StringTemplate group file (.stg) that tells ANTLR how to express all of the parsing elements needed to generate code.  You will see templates called ParserFile, Parser, Lexer, CodeBlockForAlt, AltBlock, etc... Each of these must be described how to build the indicated chunk of code. Your best bet is to find the closest existing target, copy that template file, and tweak to suit.\nCreate a runtime library to support the parsers generated by ANTLR. Under directory runtime/X, you are in complete control of the directory structure as dictated by common usage of that target language. For example, Java has: runtime/Java/lib and runtime/Java/src directories. Under src, you will find a directory structure for package org.antlr.v4.runtime and below.\nCreate a template file for runtime tests. All you have to do is provide a few templates that indicate how to print values and declare variables. Our runtime test mechanism in dir runtime-testsuite will automatically generate code using these templates for each target and check the test results.  It needs to know how to define various class fields, compare members and so on. You must create a X.test.stg file underneath runtime-testsuite/resources/org/antlr/v4/test/runtime. Again, your best bet is to copy the templates from the closest language to your target and tweak it to suit.\nCreate test files under /runtime-testsuite/test/org/antlr/v4/test/runtime. They will load defined test cases in each test descriptor. Also add the /runtime-testsuite/test/org/antlr/v4/test/runtime/X/BaseXTest.java which defines how test cases will execute and output.\nCreate/edit shell scripts in /.travis and /appveyor.yml to run tests in CI pipelines.\n\n1.2. Getting started\n\nFork the antlr/antlr4 repository at github to your own user so that you have repository username/antlr4.\nClone username/antlr4, the forked repository, to your local disk.  Your remote origin will be the forked repository on GitHub. Add a remote upstream to the original antlr/antlr4 repository (URL https://github.com/antlr/antlr4.git). Changes that you would like to contribute back to the project are done with pull requests.\nTry to build it before doing anything$ mvn compile\n\nThat should proceed with success. See Building ANTLR for more details.\n\n"}}}
